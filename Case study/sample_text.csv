Text of the speech by Chinese President Hu Jintao given to federal parliament today:
The Honourable Neil Andrew, Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Honourable Paul
Calvert, President of the Senate, the Honourable Prime Minister John Howard, distinguished
members of the federal parliament of Australia, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am delighted to meet with you today, and address such a distinguished audience at the
Australian parliament building.
Let me begin by expressing, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, my best wishes to
you and, through you, to the courageous and hard-working Australian people.
Though located in different hemispheres and separated by high seas, the people of China and
Australia enjoy a friendly exchange that dates back centuries.
The Chinese people have all along cherished amicable feelings about the Australian people.
Back in the 1420s, the expeditionary fleets of China's Ming Dynasty reached Australian shores.
For centuries, the Chinese sailed across vast seas and settled down in what they called
Southern Land, or today's Australia.
They brought Chinese culture to this land and lived harmoniously with the local people,
contributing their proud share to Australia's economy, society and its thriving pluralistic
culture.
More than three decades have passed since China and Australia established diplomatic
relations.
The bilateral ties have stood the tests of time and international vicissitudes, and made steady
headway.
To consolidate and develop its all-round cooperation with Australia is a key component of
China's external relations.
We have always viewed our friendly ties with Australia from a strategic and long-term
perspective.

To cultivate deeper and all-round cooperation between the two countries is the common
aspiration of the two governments and peoples.
This afternoon, I will have an in-depth exchange of views with Prime Minister Howard on
bilateral ties and the regional and international issues of mutual interest.
We will also sign a series of bilateral documents on cooperation.
All this shows that China-Australia cooperation in the various fields is going deeper and
broader.
I am convinced that China and Australia will shape a relationship of all-round cooperation that
features a high degree of mutual trust, long-term friendship and mutual benefit, a relationship
that makes our two peoples both winners.
How should countries go about their relations with one another in this complicated and diverse
world?
It is a question that is on the minds of many people.
We are of the view that for a smooth conduct of state-to-state relations and for lasting peace
and common prosperity, all countries should act in compliance with the following principles:
First, politically, they should respect each other, seek common ground while putting aside
differences and endeavour to expand areas of agreement.
Our world is a diverse place like a rainbow of many colours.
Civilisations, social systems, development models, as different as they may be, should
nonetheless respect one another, learning from each other's strong points to make up for one's
own weakness amid competition and comparison and achieving common development by
seeking common ground while shelving differences.
By mutual respect politically, we mean that the political system and path of political
development chosen by the people of each country should be respected.
Democracy is the common pursuit of mankind, and all countries must earnestly protect the
democratic rights of the people.
In the past 20 years and more since China embarked on the road of reform and opening up, we
have moved steadfastly to promote political restructuring and vigorously build democratic
politics under socialism.
While upholding and improving our systems of peoples congresses, multi-party cooperation
and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and regional ethnic
autonomy, we have advanced the process of scientific and democratic decision-making and
promoted grassroots democracy, protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms, and democratic
elections, democratic decision-making, democratic management and democratic supervision
by the people in the country's political, economic, cultural and social life according to law.
We have stepped up the building of rule of law in China, making sure that there are laws to go
by, that the laws must be observed and strictly enforced and that violators must be dealt with.
As aresult, the enthusiasm, initiative and creativeness of the Chinese people of all ethnic
eroups have been galvanised, providing an immense driving force for the country's
development.

 22/01/2024, 10:17 Full text: Hu's speech
In future, we will continue to move forward our political restructuring in a vigorous and
cautious manner as our national conditions merit, improve our democratic institutions and
legal systems and build a socialist political civilisation.
True, China and Australia are different in social systems.
This is the result of different choices made by our people in light of their national conditions,
and the two countries’ different historical evolution.
As China-Australia relations prove, so long as they understand and treat each other as equals
and respect their respective national conditions and circumstances, countries with different
social systems may very well become partners of friendly cooperation with constantly increased
common ground.
Second, economically, they should complement and benefit one another, deepen their
cooperation and achieve common development.
With economic globalisation developing in such depth, no country can expect to achieve
economic development without going for effective economic and technological cooperation
with other countries and actively participating in international division of labour.
Bringing in capital, knowledge, technology and managerial expertise needed for development
at home and in return providing products and know-how with comparative advantages for the
development of others - this is how countries achieve common development through mutually
beneficial cooperation.
Right now, China has entered into a new stage of building a well-off society in an all-round way
and accelerating the socialist modernisation drive.
We are busily engaged in developing a socialist market economy and opening the country still
wider to the outside world in more areas and with a higher level of sophistication.
While speeding up strategic economic restructuring, we are vigorously implementing the
Strategies of revitalising China through science and education, of sustainable development, of
the development of the west and of renewal of the old industrial base of north-east China.
China enjoys a vast market, abundant labour, social and political stability and a vibrant
momentum for development.
A stronger and more developed China will bring growth opportunities and tangible benefits to
other countries in the world.
China and Australia are highly complementary economically.
Blessed with a vast territory and rich resources, Australia boasts of economic and technological
successes.
The potential for China-Australia economic cooperation is immense.
Past, present or future, we see Australia as our important economic partner.
China-Australia trade grew rapidly in recent years from $US87 million ($A124.67 million) in the
early years of diplomatic relations to $US10.4 billion ($A14.9 billion) in 2002.

 22/01/2024, 10:17 Full text: Hu's speech
China has become Australia's third largest trading partner, the fourth largest export market,
and the fastest-growing one.
Australia is China's ninth largest trading partner and the biggest supplier of wool.
Over the years, China has purchased large amounts of iron ore and aluminium oxide from
Australia which has such energy and mineral riches.
Last year, the two countries signed a 25-year, $25 billion deal on LNG in Guangdong, thus
laying a solid foundation for bilateral energy cooperation.
Also expanding steadily are the bilateral exchanges and cooperation in science and technology,
agriculture and animal husbandry.
By June 2003, Australia has invested in accumulative 5,600 projects in China, with a paid-in
investment exceeding $US 3.1 billion.
China has invested in 218 projects in Australia with a contractual value of $US450 million.
We are ready to be your long-term and stable cooperation partner dedicated to closer
cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit.
The trade and economic framework between China and Australia which will be signed today
marks the beginning of a brand new stage of our trade and economic cooperation.
I am convinced that this framework will help steer our bilateral cooperation in economy, trade
and other fields to continuous new highs.
Third, culturally, they should step up exchanges and enhance understanding and mutual
emulation.
Diversity in the world is a basic characteristic of human society, and also the key condition for a
lively and dynamic world as we see today.
The proud history, culture and traditions that make each country different from others are all
parts of human civilisation.
Every nation, every culture, must have some strong points of its own, and all should respect one
another, draw on each other's strength to make up for its own weakness and strive to achieve
common progress.
China has a 5,000-year civilisation, and its people of 56 ethnic groups have worked together to
shape the magnificent Chinese culture.
The Chinese culture belongs not only to the Chinese but also to the whole world.
It has flourished not only through mutual emulation and assimilation among its various ethnic
eroups but also through interactions and mutual learning with the other countries.
With reform, opening up and modernisation drive pressing ahead with full swing, we are all the
more eager to draw on the useful achievements of all civilisations.
We stand ready to step up cultural exchanges with the rest of the world in a joint promotion of
cultural prosperity.
Cultural pluralism is a distinct feature of Australian society, a feature that embodies ethnic
harmony in the country.

 22/01/2024, 10:17 Full text: Hu's speech
Just as the Australian national anthem goes, Australian people have come across the seas.
Cultural exchanges have long served as important bridges of enhanced understanding and
deepened friendship between our two peoples.
Last year was the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Australia.
While Celebrate Australia 2002 delighted Shanghai citizens, Chinese performing artists had
their debut in the famous Sydney Opera House.
In recent years, people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia have grown rapidly
with annual visits well over 100,000.
China is now the biggest source country of foreign students in Australia.
We should continue to expand our cultural exchanges, giving fuller play to culture's role as the
bridge and bond in the building of friendship between the two countries and two peoples.
Fourth, in security, they should strengthen mutual trust, cooperate on an equal footing and
endeavour to maintain peace.
Peace and development remain the dominant theme of our times.
Uncertainties undermining world peace and development are on the increase.
Traditional and non-traditional threats to security are mixed together, rendering some regions
unstable and turbulent.
Terrorism attacks from time to time, and cross-boundary crime have become more pronounced.
How to meet these challenges, secure peace and development in the world and create a stable
and harmonious homeland for all is a critical question that calls for serious consideration and
effective solution.
China advocates a new security concept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and
cooperation and strives to resolve disputes peacefully through dialogue and cooperation.
We believe in democracy in international relations. The affairs of the world should be handled
through consultation on the equal footing by all countries.
Members of international community should reaffirm their commitment to multilateralism and
give full scope to the important role of the United Nations and its Security Council in
maintaining world peace and security.
China and Australia respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, stick to non-
interference in each other's internal affairs and enjoy a growing mutual trust in the security
field.
The recent years saw increasing exchanges between the two militaries as evidenced by the
annual defence strategic dialogue for six consecutive years and frequent port calls by naval
ships of both countries.
China and Australia have shared interests in keeping the South Pacific and Asia-Pacific stable,
easing regional tensions and promoting peaceful settlement of hot-spot issues.
We are both against terrorism and hope for stronger counter-terrorism cooperation.

 22/01/2024, 10:17 Full text: Hu's speech
We are both key participants in the ARF and other regional security mechanisms.
China welcomes and supports a constructive Australian role in regional and international
affairs.
We on our part will stick to our independent foreign policy of peace, acting forever as a strong
defender of world peace and a persistent proponent of common development
We are ready to join Australia and other countries in cultivating a secure and reliable
international environment of lasting stability.
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.
The complete reunification of China at an early date is the common aspiration and firm resolve
of the entire Chinese people.
A peaceful solution to the Taiwan question serves the interests of all Chinese people, including
our compatriots in Taiwan.
It also serves the common interests of all countries in the region, including Australia.
The greatest threat to peace in the Taiwan Straits is from the splitist activities by the Taiwan
independence forces. We are firmly opposed to Taiwan independence.
The Chinese government and people look to Australia for a constructive role in China's
peaceful reunification.
There have been frequent exchanges between our two legislatures in recent years.
The Honourable Speaker Andrew and many lawmakers here have visited my country and saw
China's changes and progress first hand.
We look forward to receiving more of you in China.
Looking back, I have the gratification of seeing a fruitful past of our relations.
Looking forward, I feel confident in where the relationship is headed.
Let us join hands in writing a more luminous new chapter of China-Australia relationship of
all-round cooperation.
Thank you.

"2","2005 Hu UN 60th anniversary speech.pdf","(Translation)
Build Towards a Harmonious World of
Lasting Peace and Common Prosperity
Statement by H.E. Hu Jintao
President of the People's Republic of China
At the United Nations Summit
New York, September 15, 2005
Mr. President,
Distinguished Colleagues and Representatives,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

At this solemn and important moment, national leaders
and representatives from around the world are gathered
here to commemorate the 60"" anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations, renewing our commitment to the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter and expressing
our determination to safeguard world peace and promote
common development For this is not only the shared wish
of the people of all lands but also the common
understanding of visionary statesmen of all countries.

The United Nations was founded as a result of
mankind's persistent efforts to seek peace and development.
It embodies the lofty spirit of the world's people to ""save
succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which
twice in our lifetime has brought about untold sorrow to
mankind"" and to ""live together in peace with one another
as good neighbors"". It also carries the beautiful ideal of the
 international community to jointly promote economic and
social development. The founding of the United Nations, as

its 60 years of history has shown, is an epoch-making event,

and an important milestone in mankind's cause of peace

and progress.

In the past 60 years, amid stupendous changes around
the world and vicissitudes in the international arena, the
United Nations has gone through all kinds of tests and
traversed an extraordinary course. We are glad to see that in
the past six decades, particularly since the end of the Cold
War, the United Nations has played an important role and
made enormous achievements in maintaining world peace,
promoting common development and advancing human
progress thanks to the concerted efforts of its members to
facilitate its various endeavors.

In the past 60 years, though regional turmoil continued
and local conflicts took place from time to time, countries
have accorded greater emphasis to dialogue, cooperation
and settlement of disputes by negotiations. Working
through the United Nations to prevent and end armed
conflicts and maintain world peace has increasingly
become a universal pursuit in the international community.
Observing the international responsibility, undertaking the
international obligation, settling disputes by peaceful
means, adopting effective collective measures to jointly
safeguard regional and global security — these original
purposes of creating the United Nations have also become
the sure path towards lasting peace and universal security
in the world.

In the past 60 years, though power politics still
lingered and democratized international relations remained
elusive, dialogue, exchanges and harmonious co-existence
have become the mainstream of state-to-state relations.

2
 Mutual respect and treating each other as equals have

become an important consensus of the international

community. Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,
as well as respect for countries’ right to independently

choose their own social systems and paths of development, a
re not only important principles enshrined in the UN

Charter, but have increasingly become guiding principles

for countries with differing social systems and development
levels to establish and develop their relations.

In the past 60 years, though the benefit of development
spread rather unevenly in the world as poverty and hunger
ravaged not so few countries, the international community
has already set out the goal of reducing poverty and
promoting development. Closer cooperation for common
development has become the choice of more and more
countries. The promotion of international cooperation for
common development and win-win results is not only an
important purpose of the United Nations, but has
increasingly become an important way for countries to
achieve common development and common prosperity.

Mr. President,

Distinguished Colleagues,

The 21"" century has opened up a bright prospect for
the development of mankind As we move ahead with
safeguarding world peace and promoting common
development, we are faced with both rare opportunities and
severe challenges.

Peace, cooperation and development represent the
main theme of our times. The trend towards a multi-polar
world with a globalized economy is deepening Thanks to
the rapid advancement of science and technology,
productivity around the world has increased remarkably,

3
 and the global economy has maintained an overall growth.
Regional and global cooperation of one kind or another has
become more dynamic, and efforts to build greater
democracy in international relations picked up steam.
Mankind as a whole is making progress at a pace never
seen before.

At the same time, peace and development, the two
overriding questions before the world, have not yet been
fundamentally resolved. Local wars and conflicts caused by
varying reasons keep cropping up. The hotspot issues in
some regions remain complicated and thorny. The wealth
gap between the North and South continues to widen.
People in many countries are still being denied of the right to
subsistence and even survival. International terrorists, ethnic
separatists and religious extremists in some parts of the
world remain rampant. Many cross-boundary problems such
as environmental pollution, drug trafficking, tran
snational crimes and deadly communicable diseases have
become more salient. All this has made our road
towards universal peace and common development a
bumpy and challenging one.

Mt President,

Distinguished Colleagues,

History has been a wonderful guide. At the important
historic period when both opportunities and challenges are

presented, countries can only create a bright future for
mankind and truly put in place a harmonious world with
lasting peace and common prosperity when they rally
closely together to seize the opportunities and take on the
challenges. Let me share with you some of my views in this
connection.

First, uphold multilateralism to real'ze common

4
 security. Peace is the fundamental premise for mankind's

development. Without peace, we can neither go for new

development agenda nor prevent the destruction of the

achievements of our previous development. War and
conflict are disastrous to any country, be it big or small,

strong or weak. All countries therefore should join hands in
coping with global security threats. We must abandon the

Cold War mentality, cultivate a new security concept

featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and
cooperation, and build a fair and effective collective

security mechanism aimed at jointly preventing war and
conflict and safeguarding world peace and security.

The United Nations, as the core of the collective
security mechanism, plays an irreplaceable role in
international cooperation to ensure global security. Such a ro
le can only be strengthened and must not in any way be
weakened. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter
are crucial to safeguarding world peace and security. They
have been widely recognized as the basic norms governing
international relations and must be complied with in real
earnest. As the special agency of the UN responsible for
maintaining world peace and security, the Security Council
must be given the authority to carry out its mandate.

We should encourage and support the efforts to
peacefully settle international disputes or conflicts through
consultations and negotiations. We should all oppose acts
of encroachment on other countries' sovereignty, forceful
interference in a country's internal affairs, and willful use
or threat of military force. We should step up anti-terrorist
cooperation in a resolute fight against terrorism, working to
address both the symptoms and root causes of the problem
with special emphasis on eliminating the sources of the
menace. We should realize effective disarmament and arms
control in a fair, rational, comprehensive and balanced

5
 fashion, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
vigorously promote the international nuclear disarmament
process and maintain global strategic stability.

Second, uphold mutually beneficial cooperation to
achieve common prosperity. Development has a bearing
on the vital interests of the people of all countries, and also
on the removal of global security threats from their sources.
Without universal development and common prosperity,
our world can hardly enjoy tranquility. The deepening of
economic globalization has made countries’ interests
mutually intertwined, and their respective development
depends more closely on global development. But such
globalization should benefit all countries, developing
countries in particular, instead of leading to a more
polarized world where the poor become poorer and the rich
richer. The United Nations should take concrete measures
to implement the Millennium Development Goals,
particularly in the area of accelerating the development of
developing countries, so that the 21S“ century can truly
become a ""century of development for all"".

We should work actively to establish and improve a
multilateral trading system that is open, fair and non-
discriminatory, and further improve the international
financial regime with a view to putting in place a healthy
and orderly trading environment and a stable and efficient
financial environment conducive to global economic
growth. We should step up worldwide energy dialogue and
cooperation, jointly maintain energy security and energy
market stability, and ensure a well-supplied, secure, cost-
effective and clean energy environment conducive to global
economic growth. We should actively promote and protect
human rights, make universal education available, achieve
gender equality, upgrade public health capacity building and
ensure the enjoyment of equal right and

6
 opportunity to all-round development by ail.

The developed countries should shoulder greater
responsibility for a universal, coordinated and balanced
development in the world with further opening of their mar
kets, more technology transfer, increased aid and
greater debt forgiveness to the developing countries, those
heavily indebted poor countries and least developed ones in
particular. The developing countries should make a fuller
use of their own advantages to develop themselves, expand
South-South cooperation and promote across-the-board
progress in their own society. China will do its best and
actively contribute to the common development of all
countries.

Third, uphold the spirit of inclusiveness to build a
harmonious world together. Diversity of civilizations is a
basic feature of humanity and an important driving force
behind human progress. In the course of human history, all
civilizations have, in their own way, made a positive
contribution to the overall human progress. It is their
differences that allow them to learn from one another and
grow stronger together. Uniformity, if imposed on them, c
an only take away their vitality and cause them to become
rigid and decline. The world's civilizations may differ in
age, but none is better or more superior than others.
Differences in history, culture, social system and mode of
development should not become barriers to exchanges
between countries, let alone excuses for confrontation.

We should respect a country's right to independently
choose its own social system and path of development. In
this way, countries will go for mutual emulation instead of
deliberate exclusion, for mutual learning of respective
strong points instead of making fetish a particular model,
thus succeeding in their rejuvenation and development in

7
 line with their national conditions. We should enhance

intercivilization dialogue and exchanges, allowing cultures

to complement one another through competition and
comparison, and to develop together by seeking common

ground while putting aside differences. We should do away
with misgivings and estrangement existing between

civilizations and make humanity more harmonious and our
world more colorful. We should endeavor to preserve the

diversity of civilizations in the spirit of equality and
openness, make international relations more democratic

and jointly build towards a harmonious world where all

civilizations coexist and accommodate each other.

Fourth, promote UN reform actively and prudently.
The purposes and principles of the UN Charter are
consistent with the historic tide of peace, development and
cooperation. They also meet the requirements of sound
international relations and serve the fundamental interests
of the people around the world. We should carry out
rational and necessary reform to maintain the authority of
the United Nations, improve its efficacy and give a better
scope to its role so that it will be better empowered to take
on new threats and new challenges.

Since the UN reform is all-dimensional and
multi-faceted, it may be conducted in a step-by-step
manner with focus on the easier tasks before more difficult
ones for maximized benefits. Greater UN commitment to
the question of development should be a priority of the
reform. Efforts should be intensified to uphold the purposes
and principles of the UN Charter and strengthen the
solidarity of the UN membership.

The reform of the Security Council is an important
component of the UN reform. The reform should aim, as a
priority, to increase the representation of the developing

a
nT
 countries, African countries in particular, and allow more
countries, especially small and medium-sized countries, to
participate in the decision-making of the Security Council.
With the interests of many countries at stake, the reform
should allow full consultations before any decision is made
on the basis of the broadest consensus.

Mr. President,

Distinguished Colleagues,

I would like to reiterate here what China stands for. We
will continue to hold high the banner of peace,
development and cooperation, unswervingly follow the
road of peaceful development, firmly pursue the
independent foreign policy of peace and dedicate ourselves to
developing friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. Always integrating our development with the
common progress of mankind, we take full advantage of
the opportunities brought by world peace and development to
pursue our own development while going for better
promotion of world peace and common development
through our successful development. China will, as always,
abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
actively participate in international affairs and fulfill its intern
ational obligations, and work with other countries in
building towards a new international political and
economic order that is fair and rational. The Chinese nation
loves peace. China's development, instead of hurting or
threatening anyone, can only serve peace, stability and
common prosperity in the world.

Mr. President,

Distinguished Colleagues,

Throughout the long history, human communities have

9
 never been so closely interconnected in interests and
destinies. Our common goals have put us all in the same
boat, and the common challenges we face require that we
get united. Let us join hands and work together to build a
harmonious world with lasting peace and common
prosperity.
Thank you.

On the eve of the New Year, Chinese President Hu Jintao delivered a speech entitled ""Make Joint Efforts
to Advance World Peace, Stability and Prosperity"".
Make Joint Efforts to Advance World Peace and Prosperity
-- 2009 New Year Speech delivered by Hu Jintao, President of the People's Republic of China
Ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends,
The New Year's bell is about to ring, and 2009 is soon to begin. At this beautiful moment of bidding
farewell to the old and ushering in the new, via China Radio International, China National Radio and
China Central Television, I'm delighted to extend New Year wishes to Chinese of all ethnic groups, to
compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, to overseas Chinese and to friends all over the world!
The year of 2008 has been a very unusual and uncommon one for the Chinese people. Chinese people of
all ethnic groups united in one heart and one mind, with a perseverance, successfully dealt with the
disasters brought out by the winter storm in southern China and the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan
Province. We successfully held Beijing Olympic Games and Paralympics; We successfully launched the
manned spaceship Shenzhou VII, We successfully held the 7th Asia-Europe Meeting. The economic
strength and the overall national strength have been further strengthened. The living standard of the
Chinese people has been further improved. The Chinese people conduct friendly exchanges and
pragmatic cooperation with the rest of the world, meet grave challenges, including the international
financial crisis in a joint manner, make new contribution in terms of safeguarding world peace and
promoting common development.
This year, the Chinese people solemnly marked the 30th anniversary of China's reform and opening up.
While summing up the experience, China has mapped out new plans to further reform and open up. The
Chinese people of all ethnic groups are, with full spirits, pushing forward the process of building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and working hard to create an even better life. On
behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, | would like to express our heartfelt gratitude
to people from all around the world for their support and assistance.
The year 2009 for the Chinese people is of historic significance. The founding of the People's Republic of
China six decades ago represent a new historic period in the development of the Chinese nation. During
the past 60 years, China has experienced historic changes. The relationship between China and the rest
of the world also experienced historic changes. In the upcoming new year, we will unswervingly uphold
the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deepen the implementation of the Scientific
Outlook on Development under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three
Represents, maintain a balanced and relatively fast economic growth based on the expansion of domestic
consumption, accelerate the change of development mode and structural adjustment, increase the ability
of sustainable development, deepen the reform and opening up to inject vigor and vitality into social and
economic development, enhance social program construction, accelerate the speed of resolving hard
issues confronting citizens, maintain sound and fast social and economic development.
We will uphold the principles of one country, two systems, Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and
Macao people governing Macao with a high degree of autonomy. We will work with our compatriots in
Hong Kong and Macao to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in the two Special Administrative
Regions.
We will firmly adhere to the basic principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems, and
firmly grasp the theme of cross-Straits relations and peaceful development, strengthen the cross-straits
exchanges and cooperation, bring continuous well-being to compatriots on both sides of Taiwan Straits,
seek peace for the Taiwan Straits region and safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.

Deepen Exchanges and Cooperation for Inclusive Growth

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today, friends from the APEC member economies are gathering in Beijing for the Fifth APEC Human Resources
Development Ministerial Meeting. The theme of the meeting is ""Developing Human Resources, Vigorously Promoting
Employment and Realizing Inclusive Growth"". First of all, | wish to extend, on behalf of the Chinese government and
people, warm congratulations on the opening of the meeting and sincere welcome to all delegates.
The Asia-Pacific region is among the world's most dynamic regions with the greatest development potential. It has an
important place and role in the world economy, with the 21 APEC member economies making up nearly 60% of total
global economic output. After 21 years of development, APEC has become an economic cooperation organization in the
Asia-Pacific region that has the most full-fledged institutions and attracts the highest level of participation.
In the wake of the international financial crisis and based on our experience in dealing with the crisis, we have become
more acutely aware of one thing. In an era of deepening economic globalization, if we want to ensure sustained global
economic growth and effectively tackle the risks and challenges faced by the world economy, all economies and regions
must strengthen exchanges and cooperation and work together to address the underlying, structural issues in economic
development. The 17th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in 2009 reached consensus on inclusive growth, and
highlighted the importance of seizing the opportunities brought by economic globalization to better meet the challenges
of economic globalization and create job opportunities for the benefit of our people. To realize inclusive growth, to
resolve the social issues emerging from economic development and to lay a solid social foundation for trade promotion,
investment facilitation and long-term economic development are all major topics that we, the APEC member economies,
need to work on together.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

 22/01/2024, 11:06 President Hu Jintao's speech at the Fifth APEC Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting
The ultimate purpose of inclusive growth is to spread the benefits of economic globalization and economic development
among all economies, regions and people and to realize balanced economic and social progress through sustainable
development. Our goal is greater productivity and prosperity and a better environment. To this end, we must develop the
economy, transform the economic development pattern, raise the efficiency of economic development, and create more
social wealth so that our people can lead a better life. We should pursue social equity and justice. To this end, we must
ensure everyone equal access to development opportunities, steadily put in place a system for guaranteeing social
equity with a focus on ensuring fairness in rights, opportunities, rules and distribution, and eradicate obstacles that keep
our people from participating in economic development or sharing the fruits of economic development. We should put
people first, ensure and improve people's livelihood, institute a social safety net that covers all, and address issues vital
to people's livelihood, including education, labor and employment, health care, old-age support and housing. We should
work hard to ensure that development is for the people and by the people and its fruits are shared among the people.
Here, | want to make the following four proposals within the context of the theme of the meeting:
First, give priority to human resources development. Human resources development holds the key to people's full
participation in economic development and to improvement of conditions for their survival and development. It also
provides the basis for sustainable economic development and inclusive growth. Development of human resources can
be sustainable. Among all the advantages we are endowed with, the advantage in human resources is the most reliable.
It can bring out the greatest potential in us and its development calls for our utmost efforts. We should be committed to
the concept that human resources are the number one resources in economic and social development, and should
speed up efforts to form strategies that give priority to human resources development. We should focus on readjusting
the structures of human resources and investing in human resources development. We should make institutional
innovations in human resources development by building a development mechanism that is jointly invested by the
government, society, employers and individuals. And we should actively plan for and make readjustments to the
professional mix, level and distribution of human resources, so as to boost the innovation power of human resources of
all kinds.
second, implement the strategy of full employment. Employment is vital to people's livelihood. Full employment in
society will enable more people to share the fruits of economic and social development. We should make full
employment our priority goal in economic and social development and implement the strategy of expanding employment
to maximize employment and development opportunities for workers and ensure full employment for our people. The
government should take greater responsibility in employment promotion. We should implement a more proactive
employment policy and relevant fiscal, financial and industrial policies and build a public service system for employment
that covers both rural and urban areas. We need to improve the long-term employment aid system that is accessible to
all people with difficulties, and enhance the interactive mechanism between employment and social security. We also
need to promote decent work as well as harmonious labor relations.
Third, improve the quality and competence of our workers. We need to improve the quality of workers and make sure
that economic growth is truly driven by scientific and technological advancement, improvement of workers’ quality and
innovation in management. This meets the need for people's all-round development and provides a major guarantee for
economic and social development. We need to improve the quality of our workers to promote transformation of the
economic growth pattern, economic restructuring and upgrading and harmonious growth between the economy and
society. We should offer proper guidance to our workers so that they will improve their moral and educational
background, raise their working capacity, obtain new knowledge, skills and know-how and become high-quality workers
to meet the needs of economic and social development in the new era. We should take steps to adapt to changes in
economic growth pattern and improvement of economic structures, and build and improve a vocational training system
accessible to all workers and formulate a guiding system, training system, evaluation system and incentive system to
help our workers improve their professional and technical skills in an all-round manner. It is important to bring into full
play the role of education in improving the quality and capacity of workers. To achieve the goal of building a study-
oriented society and realizing life-long education, we need to give priority to education, make it more modernized, and
ensure its non-profit and universal nature. We should protect our citizens’ right to education as provided for by law and
work hard to nurture high-quality workers, professional talents and leading creative talents.
Fourth, build a social security system that ensures sustainable development. A sound social security system is a major
guarantee for economic and social development; it also provides a safety net for social harmony and stability. On the

 22/01/2024, 11:06 President Hu Jintao's speech at the Fifth APEC Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting
basis of economic development, we should build a social security system covering both urban and rural residents, and
ensure its coverage is broad, basic, multi-tiered and sustainable. We should better coordinate social insurance, social
assistance and social welfare, and raise the level of social security steadily. We should vigorously increase social
security input in government budget, expand the coverage of social insurance, improve the social assistance system,
and promote social welfare and charity endeavors so that we will better ensure our people's rights to education,
employment, medical and old-age care and housing.
Practical and win-win cooperation is essential if we, APEC member economies, are to achieve common development.
We should beef up economic and technical cooperation, advance regional trade and investment liberalization, and
narrow the development gap among member economies to promote common prosperity. We should work more closely
in employment, social security and other fields by promoting policy dialogue and experience sharing. We should broaden
our cooperation in human resources development, build platforms for technical cooperation, and raise our cooperation
level with the focus on helping developing members in human resources development. To this end, China has decided to
launch, together with other APEC member economies, the APEC Skills Development Promotion Project.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
China is a strong supporter and follower of inclusive growth, a concept that is consistent with our pursuit of scientific
development and social harmony. While speeding up the transformation of economic growth pattern and maintaining
stable and relatively fast economic growth, China is committed to integrating economic development with improvement
of people's lives. We focus on addressing issues that directly concern people's biggest and most immediate interests,
and endeavor to promote social progress designed to improve people's livelihood. In response to the international
financial crisis, China has introduced the policy of ensuring economic growth, people's livelihood and stability. We
adopted a proactive fiscal policy and a moderately easy monetary policy. We vigorously promoted economic
development, focusing on improving efficiency, and, at the same time, increased input in social programs, intensifying
our efforts to improve the social safety net and address problems concerning people's livelihood. We are keenly aware
that despite the significant achievements in economic and social development, China remains the largest developing
country in the world. China's basic national conditions, a huge population, weak economic foundation and imbalance in
development, remain unchanged, and we face many serious challenges in economic and social development. We will
stay committed to scientific development, deepen reform and opening-up, and push forward economic, political, cultural,
social and ecological development in an all-round way. We will better coordinate the various links and aspects in our
modernization drive, create even more social wealth, and improve people's lives to achieve all-round, balanced and
sustainable economic and social development.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region faces unprecedented opportunities of development. We, APEC members, should
work together and make the best use of this APEC cooperation platform to deepen and broaden our cooperation. Hand
in hand, let's move toward the objective of enduring peace and common prosperity for the benefit of people in the Asia-
Pacific and the world at large.
| wish this meeting a complete success!
Thank you.

Dear Colleagues,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
| am delighted to meet you at the opening of the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing, as we are gathered
here both to renew the friendship between the Chinese and African peoples and discuss ways to boost China-Africa friendship and all-round cooperation. On
behalf of the Chinese government and people and in my own name, | wish to extend a very warm welcome to all the distinguished guests coming from afar. |
also wish to take this opportunity to convey through you the cordial greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the brotherly African people!
In October 2000, FOCAC was set up in response to the call of the times. This initiative demonstrates the shared desire of the Chinese and African people to seek
peace, cooperation and development in a changing world. In the past 12 years since its founding, the FOCAC member states, maintaining unity and working
together, have made important progress in strengthening this mechanism of cooperation. The theme of the current Ministerial Conference is ""build on past
achievements and open up new prospects for the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership."" China and Africa should, with both current and long-term
needs in mind, redouble efforts to draw up a blueprint for promoting our cooperation in the next stage and lay a solid foundation for making new and greater
progress in growing China-Africa relations in the years ahead.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
When we met here six years ago at the FOCAC Beijing Summit, China and Africa decided to establish a new type of strategic partnership. Since then, important
progress has been made in realizing this vision thanks to the joint efforts of both sides. China and Africa have enhanced all-round friendly political relations

featuring mutual respect and mutual trust. We have conducted more frequent high-level exchange of visits and more in-depth dialogue and exchanges, and
provided stronger support to each other. China's relations with all African countries, the African Union (AU) and other regional organizations have grown in
strength. China has formed strategic partnerships and launched strategic dialogue mechanisms with many African countries. And China has supported African
countries in independently resolving hotspot issues in the region and advancing the process of African integration. China and Africa have deepened practical
economic cooperation featuring mutual benefit. We have joined hands to fight the international financial crisis, effectively implemented the eight measures for
practical cooperation announced at the Beijing Summit and eight additional measures announced at the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and made steady
progress in building a framework of all-round cooperation. China's trade with and investment in Africa have been expanding. In 2011, our two-way trade reached
166.3 billion U.S. dollars, three times the figure in 2006. Cumulative Chinese direct investment in Africa has exceeded 15 billion U.S. dollars, with investment
projects covering 50 countries. The AU Conference Center and Office Complex built by China was handed over to the African side. China's assistance to Africa
has been growing steadily. China has built over 100 schools, 30 hospitals, 30 anti-malaria centers and 20 agricultural technology demonstration centers in Africa.
It has met the pledge of providing 15 billion U.S. dollars of lending of a preferential nature to Africa. China and Africa have conducted increasing people-to-
people and cultural exchanges featuring mutual learning. A number of activities have been carried out, including the Chinese/African Cultures in Focus, Joint
Research and Exchange Plan, Think Tanks Forum, People's Forum and Young Leaders Forum. China has trained close to 40,000 African personnel in various
sectors and provided over 20,000 government scholarships to African countries. China and Africa have set up 29 Confucius Institutes or Classrooms in 22
African countries. Twenty pairs of leading Chinese and African universities have entered into cooperation under the 20+20 Cooperation Plan for Chinese and
African Institutions of Higher Education. China and African have enjoyed closer ties of solidarity and coordination featuring mutual help and mutual
support in international affairs. Our two sides have worked closely on UN reform, countering climate change, sustainable development, WTO Doha Round
negotiations and other major issues. In so doing, we have upheld the common interests of developing countries, promoted democracy in international relations,
and we are working to make the international order more just and equitable.
Facts have shown that the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership is the result of continuous growth of the traditional friendship between the two sides. It
meets the fundamental interests of China and Africa and conforms to the global trend of peace, development and cooperation. The forging of this partnership has
inaugurated a new historical process in growing China-Africa relations and added new momentum to China-Africa exchanges and cooperation. | am confident
that, with our joint efforts, the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership will embrace an even brighter future.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Tremendous changes have taken place in the world since we met here six years ago. Peace, development and cooperation remain the trend of our times. On the
other hand, uncertainties and destabilizing factors in international developments have notably increased. The impact of the international financial crisis is still with
us. Regional and international hotspot issues keep emerging. The unjust and inequitable international political and economic order still affects and hinders world
peace and development. Developing countries have maintained strong momentum of growth, but they are also confronted with many difficulties and challenges.
In recent years, the African countries and people, working with perseverance and vision, have made remarkable achievements in promoting Africa's peace and
development. But Africa still faces major challenges in its development endeavor. The international community should continue to give high priority to enhancing
peace and development in Africa and increase input in this area. It should respect Africa's wish, listen to its views, address its concerns and help it meet the
Millennium Development Goals at an early date.
China is the world's largest developing country, and Africa is home to the largest number of developing countries in the world. China and Africa, together with
over one third of the world's population, are an important force for advancing world peace and development. China and Africa share a common destiny, and
China-Africa friendship is cherished by the Chinese and African peoples. The Chinese and African peoples have always treated each other as equals and with
sincerity and friendship, extended mutual support and pursued common development. No matter how the international landscape may change, China will remain
unchanged in its commitment to supporting Africa's peace, stability, development and unity. We will give genuine support to African countries' independent choice
of development paths and genuinely help African countries strengthen capacity for self development. We will continue to stand firm with the African people and
forever be a good friend, good partner and good brother of the African people.
In a world of profound changes, the Chinese and African peoples have high hopes for the growth of China-Africa relations. This means that we should, with a
keen sense of responsibility and mission, adapt to new developments, set new goals, take new measures, and solve new problems so as to open up new
prospects in building a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership.
-- To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership, China and Africa should strengthen political mutual trust. We should
carry forward our traditional friendship, maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges, enhance strategic dialogue, increase experience sharing on
governance, do away with external interference, and deepen mutual understanding and trust. China will, together with the international community, staunchly
support African countries in upholding peace and stability and seeking strength through unity. China will play a positive and constructive role in African affairs.
-- To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership, China and Africa should expand practical cooperation. We should
expand areas and explore new ways of cooperation. We should do more to conduct cooperation in agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and other priority
development areas in Africa. We should work harder to carry out advanced cooperation in investment, finance, services and technology transfer and improve
trade mix and upgrade trade. And we should redouble efforts to help African countries enhance capacity for self development. Our goal is for China-Africa
cooperation to benefit more of our peoples.
-- To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership, China and Africa should increase cultural and people-to-people
exchanges. We should encourage exchanges and interactions between our two great civilizations at various levels and in various ways, strengthen exchanges
in education, culture, science and technology, health, sports and tourism, and increase contacts between youth, women, people's organizations, media and
academic institutions of the two sides. In this way, we will provide intellectual inspiration and cultural support for China-Africa cooperation and win even greater
popular support for China-Africa friendship.

 22/01/2024, 11:03 Open Up New Prospects for A New Type of China-Africa Strategic Partnership
-- To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership, China and Africa should increase coordination and cooperation in
international affairs. We should jointly uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and promote democracy in international
relations and harmonious and balanced global development. We should oppose the practices of the big bullying the small, the strong domineering over the weak,
and the rich oppressing the poor. We should step up consultation and coordination, accommodate each other's concerns, and work together to meet global
challenges on climate change, food security and sustainable development.
-- To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership, China and Africa should make FOCAC stronger. We should, in light of
the latest international developments and new progress in the growth of China-Africa relations, develop new thinking and new forms of cooperation to enhance
FOCAC. We should motivate FOCAC members and fully tap their enthusiasm and creativity so as to enhance the cohesion and influence of FOCAC, and make it
a more effective platform for cooperation.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In the past six decades and more since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and particularly since the reform and opening-up program was launched
over 30 years ago, China has made remarkable achievements in its economic and social development. We will always remember and we are grateful from the
bottom of our heart for the vigorous support and help the African countries and people have given to our development effort. While the way ahead will not be a
smooth one for us, we have full confidence in China's future development. China will stay committed to peaceful development. At the same time, we will
endeavor to uphold world peace and promote common development.
In the next three years, the Chinese government will take measures in the following five priority areas to support the cause of peace and development in Africa
and boost a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership.
First, we will expand cooperation in investment and financing to support sustainable development in Africa. China will provide 20 billion dollars of credit
line to African countries to assist them in developing infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Second, we will continue to increase assistance to Africa to bring the benefits of development to the African people. China will build more agricultural
technology demonstration centers as necessary to help African countries increase production capacity. China will implement the ""African Talents Program"" to
train 30,000 personnel in various sectors for Africa, offer 18,000 government scholarships, and build cultural and vocational skills training facilities in African
countries. China will deepen medical and health cooperation with Africa, send 1,500 medical personnel to Africa, and continue to carry out the ""Brightness
Action"" activities in Africa to provide free treatment for cataract patients. China will help African countries enhance capacity building in meteorological
infrastructure and forest protection and management. China will continue to carry out well-drilling and water supply projects in Africa to provide safe drinking
water for the African people.
Third, we will support the African integration process and help Africa enhance capacity for overall development. China will establish a partnership with
Africa on transnational and trans-regional infrastructural development, support related project planning and feasibility studies and encourage established Chinese
companies and financial institutions to take part in transnational and trans-regional infrastructural development in Africa. China will help African countries upgrade
customs and commodity inspection facilities to promote intra-regional trade facilitation.
Fourth, we will enhance people-to-people friendship to lay a solid foundation of public support for enhancing China-Africa common development.
China proposes to carry out ""China-Africa people-to-people friendship action"" to support and promote exchanges and cooperation between people's
organizations, women and youth of the two sides. China proposes to set up a ""China-Africa Press Exchange Center"" in China to encourage exchanges and visits
between Chinese and African media, and China supports exchange of correspondents by media organizations of the two sides. China will continue to implement
the China-Africa Joint Research and Exchange Plan to sponsor 100 programs for research, exchange and cooperation by academic institutions and scholars of
the two sides.
Fifth, we should promote peace and stability in Africa and create a secure environment for Africa's development. China will launch the ""Initiative on
China-Africa Cooperative Partnership for Peace and Security,"" deepen cooperation with the AU and African countries in peace and security in Africa, provide
financial support for the AU peace-keeping missions in Africa and the development of the African Standby Force, and train more officials in peace and security
affairs and peace-keepers for the AU.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
To open up new prospects for a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership and jointly build a harmonious world of durable peace and common prosperity is
our shared goal and responsibility. Let us join hands and work for a bright future for us all.
In conclusion, | wish the Fifth FOCAC Ministerial Conference every success!
Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
Good morning! It is a great pleasure for me to come to the College of Europe and meet with faculty members and students. First of all, my warm
greetings and best wishes to you and all those in Europe who have shown interest in and support to the development of China.
In the Flemish language, Bruges means ""bridge"". A bridge not only makes life more convenient; it could also be a symbol of communication,
understanding and friendship. | have come to Europe to build, together with our European friends, a bridge of friendship and cooperation across
the Eurasian continent.
Before coming here, | visited a Volvo plant in Ghent together with King Philippe and Queen Mathilde. Volvo Cars Ghent, the largest car
manufacturer in Belgium, has become a model of economic and technological cooperation between China, Belgium and Sweden. It has actually
set up a bridge linking Chinese investment with European technology. What it leads to is mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.
The College of Europe was created after the end of World War Il as a result of people's reflection of the war and their yearning for peace. Human
history has far too often been haunted by the specter of war. Having suffered from the calamity of World War II, people in Europe began to think
over about their past misery and started to unite, under the leadership of statesmen like Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, in a joint pursuit for
lasting peace and prosperity.
After more than half a century of development, the College today not only serves as an important think tank for the European Union. It is also
seen as the cradle of political elites of Europe. In the words of Mr. Van Rompuy, the College has always been ""at the heart of European
integration"" and is in itself an expression of the faith in Europe born ""out of the ruins of war"".
Faculty Members,
Students,
In 1949 when the College of Europe was established, the People's Republic of China was founded, heralding a new historical era in the
development of the Chinese nation. Later in 1975, late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai and Sir Christopher Soames, acting on their assessment of
the world situation then, decided that China and the European Economic Community should establish diplomatic relations. Today, China and the
EU have a comprehensive strategic partnership. We have established dialogue and consultation mechanisms in over 60 areas. Our trade last
year reached 559.1 billion US dollars. Over five million visits are exchanged each year. And about 300,000 of our students are studying overseas

 22/01/2024, 12:01 Speech by President Xi Jinping at the College of Europe
either in Europe or in China. The relationship between China and the EU has become one of the most important bilateral relationships in the
world.
Having said that, we should not forget that there is still greater room for the growth of China-EU relations and the potential is yet to be fully
tapped. To move our relationship forward, China needs to know more about Europe, and Europe needs to know more about China. For any
country in the world, the past always holds the key to the present and the present is always rooted in the past. Only when we know where a
country has come from, could we possibly understand why the country is what it is today, and only then could we realize in which direction it is
heading.
So let me use this opportunity to describe to you what a country China is. | hope it will be helpful to you as you try to observe, understand and
study China. Of course, a thorough account of the country would be too big a topic for today, so | will just focus on the following few features of
China.
First, China has a time-honored civilization. Of the world's ancient civilizations, the Chinese civilization has continued uninterrupted to this day. In
fact, it has spanned over 5,000 years. The Chinese characters, invented by our ancestors several millennia ago, are still used today. Over 2,000
years ago, there was an era of great intellectual accomplishments in China, which is referred to as ""the period of one hundred masters and
schools of thought"". Great thinkers such as Laozi, Confucius and Mozi, to name just a few, explored a wide range of topics from the universe to
the Earth, and from man's relations with nature to relations amongst human beings and to that between the individual and society. The extensive
and profound schools of thought they established covered many important ideas, such as the moral injunction of fidelity to one's parents and
brothers and to the monarch and friends, the sense of propriety, justice, integrity and honor, the emphasis on benevolence and kindness towards
fellow human beings and the belief that man should be in harmony with nature, follow nature's course and unremittingly pursue self-renewal.
These values and teachings still carry a profound impact on Chinese people's way of life today, underpinning the unique value system in the
Chinese outlook of the world, of society and of life itself. And this unique and time-honored intellectual legacy has instilled a strong sense of
national confidence in the Chinese people and nurtured a national spirit with patriotism at the very core.
Second, China has gone through many vicissitudes. For several thousand years before the industrial revolution, China had been leading the
world in economic, technological and cultural development. However, feudal rulers of the 18th and 19th centuries closed the door of China in
boastful ignorance and China was since left behind in the trend of development. The country was subdued to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
society. As a result of incessant foreign invasions thereafter, China experienced great social turmoil and its people had to lead a life of extreme
destitution. Poverty prompted the call for change and people experiencing turmoil aspired for stability. After a hundred years of persistent and
unyielding struggle, the Chinese people, sacrificing tens of millions of lives, ultimately took their destiny back into their own hands. Nevertheless,
the memory of foreign invasion and bullying has never been erased from the minds of the Chinese people, and that explains why we cherish so
dearly the life we lead today. The Chinese people want peace; we do not want war. This is the reason why China follows an independent foreign
policy of peace. China is committed to non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and China will not allow others to interfere in its own
affairs. This is the position we have upheld in the past. It is what we will continue to uphold in the future.
Third, China is a socialist country with Chinese characteristics. In 1911, the revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen overthrew the autocratic monarchy
that had ruled China for several thousand years. But once the old system was gone, where China would go became the question. The Chinese
people then started exploring long and hard for a path that would suit China's national conditions. They experimented with constitutional
monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, multi-party system and presidential government, yet nothing really worked. Finally, China took
on the path of socialism. Admittedly, in the process of building socialism, we have had successful experience and also made mistakes. We have
even suffered serious setbacks. After the ""reform and opening-up"" was launched under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, we have, acting in
line with China's national conditions and the trend of the times, explored and blazed a trail of development and established socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Our aim is to build a socialist market economy, democracy, an advanced culture, a harmonious society and a sound eco-
system, uphold social equity and justice, promote all-round development of the people, pursue peaceful development, complete the building of a
moderately prosperous society in all respects and eventually achieve modernization and ensure prosperity for all. The uniqueness of China's
cultural tradition, history and circumstances determines that China needs to follow a development path that suits its own reality. In fact, we have
found such a path and achieved success along this path.
Fourth, China is the world's biggest developing country. China has made historic progress in development. It is now the second largest economy
in the world. It has achieved in several decades what took developed countries several centuries to achieve. This is, without doubt, a proud
achievement for a country whose population exceeds 1.3 billion. In the meantime, we are clearly aware that the large size of the Chinese
economy, when divided by 1.3 billion, sends China to around the 80th place in terms of per capita GDP. In China, over 74 million people rely on
basic living allowances; each year, more than 10 million urban people would join the job market and several hundred million rural people need to
be transferred to non-agricultural jobs and settle down in urban areas; more than 85 million people are with disabilities; and more than 200 million
people are still living under the poverty line set by the World Bank, and that is roughly the population of France, Germany and the UK combined.
In the 40-day-long season of the last Chinese New Year, China's airlines, railroads and highways transported 3.6 billion passengers, which
means 90 million people were on the move each day. Therefore, to make the lives of the 1.3 billion Chinese people more comfortable requires
still arduous efforts for years to come. Economic development remains the top priority for China, and we still need to work on that basis to
achieve social progress in all areas.
Fifth, China is a country undergoing profound changes. Our ancestors taught us that ""as heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman
should constantly strive for self-perfection"", and that ""if one can make things better for one day, he should make them better every day"". Being
faced with fierce international competition is like sailing against the current. One either forges ahead or falls behind. Reform, which was first

ie.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zt/diplomacy/201404/t20140408_ 2540471 .btm 2/4
 22/01/2024, 12:01 Speech by President Xi Jinping at the College of Europe
forced upon us by problems, goes deeper in addressing the problems. We know keenly that reform and opening-up is an ongoing process that
will never stop. China's reform has entered a deep water zone, where problems crying to be resolved are all difficult ones. What we need is the
courage to move the reform forward. To use a Chinese saying, we must ""get ready to go into the mountain, being fully aware that there may be
tigers to encounter"". The principle we have laid down for reform is to act with courage while moving forward with steady steps. As we say in
China, he who wants to accomplish a big and difficult undertaking should start with easier things first and make sure that all details are attended
to. With the deepening of reform, China will continue to undergo profound changes. | believe that our efforts of deepening reform
comprehensively will not only provide strong momentum for China's modernization drive, but also bring new development opportunities to the
world.
To observe and understand China properly, one needs to bear in mind both China's past and present and draw reference from both China's
accomplishments and the Chinese way of thinking. The 5,000-year-long Chinese civilization, the 170-year struggle by the Chinese people since
modern times, the 90-year-plus journey of the Communist Party of China, the 60-year-plus development of the People's Republic and the 30-
year-plus reform and opening-up should all be taken into account. They each make an integral part of China's history, and none should be taken
out of the historical context. One can hardly understand China well without a proper understanding of China's history, culture, the Chinese
people's way of thinking and the profound changes taking place in China today.
The world's development is multi-dimensional, and its history is never a linear movement. China cannot copy the political system or development
model of other countries, because it would not fit us and it might even lead to catastrophic consequences. The Chinese people, over 2,000 year
ago, had come to understand this from a simple fact that the tasty orange, grown in southern China, would turn sour once it is grown in the north.
The leaves may look the same, but the fruits taste quite different, because the north means different location and different climate.
A French writer once said that friends are transparent to friends because they exchange life. | hope what | just shared with you could draw for you
a more transparent picture of China. | also sincerely hope that the College of Europe will produce a large number of talents who know and
understand China well so as to provide a constant source of talent and intellectual support for the growth of China-Europe relations.
Faculty Members,
Students,
China and Europe may seem far apart geographically, but we are in fact in the same time and the same space. | even feel that we are close to
each other, as if in the same neighborhood. Both China and Europe are in a crucial stage of development and facing unprecedented
opportunities and challenges. As | just said, we hope to work with our European friends to build a bridge of friendship and cooperation across the
Eurasian continent. For that, we need to build four bridges for peace, growth, reform and progress of civilization, so that the China-EU
comprehensive strategic partnership will take on even greater global significance.
We need to build a bridge of peace and stability linking the two strong forces of China and the EU. China and the EU take up one tenth of the
total area on Earth and one fourth of the world's population. Together, we take three permanent seats on the Security Council of the United
Nations. We all need peace, multilateralism and dialogue, instead of war, unilateralism and confrontation. We need to enhance communication
and coordination on global issues and play a key role in safeguarding world peace and stability. Civilization and culture can spread, so can peace
and development. China stands ready to work with the EU to let the sunlight of peace drive away the shadow of war and the bonfire of prosperity
warm up the global economy in the cold early spring, and enable the whole mankind to embark on the path of peaceful development and win-win
cooperation.
We need to build a bridge of growth and prosperity linking the two big markets of China and the EU. China and the EU are the two most
important major economies in the world with our combined economy accounting for one third of the global economy. We must uphold open
market, speed up negotiations on the investment agreement, actively explore the possibility of a free trade area, and strive to achieve the
ambitious goal of bringing two-way trade to one trillion US dollars by 2020. We should also study how to dovetail China-EU cooperation with the
initiative of developing the Silk Road economic belt so as to integrate the markets of Asia and Europe, energize the people, businesses, capital
and technologies of Asia and Europe, and make China and the EU the twin engines for global economic growth.
We need to build a bridge of reform and progress linking the reform processes in China and the EU. Both China and the EU are pursuing reforms
that are unprecedented in human history, and both are sailing uncharted waters. We may enhance dialogue and cooperation on macro-economy,
public policy, regional development, rural development, social welfare and other fields. We need to respect each other's path of reform and draw
upon each other's reform experience. And we need to promote world development and progress through our reform efforts.
We need to build a bridge of common cultural prosperity linking the two major civilizations of China and Europe. China represents in an important
way the Eastern civilization, while Europe is the birthplace of the Western civilization. The Chinese people are fond of tea and the Belgians love
beer. To me, the moderate tea drinker and the passionate beer lover represent two ways of understanding life and knowing the world, and | find
them equally rewarding. When good friends get together, they may want to drink to their heart's content to show their friendship. They may also
choose to sit down quietly and drink tea while chatting about their life. In China, we value the idea of preserving ""harmony without uniformity"", and
here in the EU people stress the need to be ""united in diversity"". Let us work together for all flowers of human civilizations to blossom together.
In spite of changes in the international landscape, China has always supported European integration and a bigger role in international affairs by a
united, stable and prosperous EU. China will soon release its second EU policy paper to reiterate the high importance it places on the EU and on
its relations with the EU. Last year, China and the EU jointly formulated the Strategic Agenda 2020 for China-EU Cooperation, setting out a host
ie.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zt/diplomacy/201404/t20140408_ 2540471 .btm 3/4
 22/01/2024, 12:01 Speech by President Xi Jinping at the College of Europe
of ambitious goals for China-EU cooperation in nearly 100 areas. The two sides should work in concert to turn the blueprint into reality at an early
date and strive for greater progress in China-EU relations in the coming decade.
Faculty Members,
Students,
The College of Europe has, in recent years, placed increasing importance on China. It has opened courses on Europe-China relations. It is also
busy preparing for the launch of a Europe-China research center devoted to studies of Europe-China relations. China has decided to work with
the College of Europe to build a ""Chinese Library"", the first of its kind in an EU member country, and will provide, for the purpose of academic
research, 10,000 books, videos and films on Chinese history, culture and the achievements China has made in various fields.
As we Chinese believe, one needs to not only read 10,000 books, but also travel 10,000 miles to know the world around us. | suggest that you go
to China more often to see for yourselves what China is like. What you hear from others might be false, but what you see with your own eyes is
real. China intends to work with the EU to bring the number of students exchanged between the two sides to 300,000 each year by 2020.
Young people are always energetic and full of dreams. They are the future of China, Europe and, indeed, of the world. | hope that Chinese and
European students will perceive the world with equality, respect and love and treat different civilizations with appreciation, inclusiveness and the
spirit of mutual learning. This way, you will promote mutual understanding and knowledge among the people of China, Europe and other parts of
the world, and with your youthful energy and hard work, make our planet a better place to live in.
Thank you.

President Hollande,
CHINADAILY F®RLM
Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
Today, we are gathering here in Paris for the opening ceremony of the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change. Our presence shows that terrorism cannot hold back
mankind's efforts to address climate change and pursue a better future. Let me take this
opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to the French people and my gratitude to
President Hollande and the French government for their meticulous preparations for this
conference.
Thanks to joint efforts of all parties since the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change entered into force over 20 years ago, global actions on climate change have
made progress although there are still numerous difficulties and challenges. This Paris
 Conference is hence convened to strengthen implementation of the UNFCCC and bring about
a comprehensive, balanced, ambitious and binding agreement on climate change. The
conference is also expected to come up with equitable, reasonable and effective global
solutions to climate change and explore pathways and governance models for mankind to
achieve sustainable development. The French writer Victor Hugo once observed in Les
Miserables that ""supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions."" (Les resources
supremes sortent des resolutions extremes.) | believe that with all parties making joint efforts
with sincerity and confidence, the Paris Conference will yield satisfying results and meet the
high expectations of the international community.

Dear Colleagues,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

A successful international agreement should not just address immediate challenges but more
importantly, it should also present a vision for the future. The Paris agreement should focus
on strengthening post-2020 global actions on climate change and boost global efforts to
pursue sustainable development.

- The Paris agreement should help meet the goals of the UNFCCC and chart the course
for green development. The agreement should follow the principles and rules set out in the
UNFCCC and contribute to its full and effective implementation. The agreement should put
effective control on the increase of atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and set
up incentive mechanisms to encourage countries to pursue green, circular and low-carbon
development featuring both economic growth and an effective response to climate change.

- The Paris agreement should help galvanize global efforts and encourage broad
participation. The agreement should provide institutional arrangements that propel countries
to make concerted efforts. Besides governments, it should also mobilize businesses, non-
governmental organizations and all players in society to participate in international
cooperation on climate change, thus raising public awareness of pooling resources on climate
change.

- The Paris agreement should help increase input of resources to ensure actions on
climate change. To obtain financial and technical support for capacity building is essential for
developing countries to address climate change. Developed countries should honor their
commitment of mobilizing US$100 billion each year before 2020 and provide stronger
financial support to developing countries afterwards. It is also important that climate-friendly
technologies should be transferred to developing countries to help them build green economy.
- The Paris agreement should accommodate the national conditions of various
countries and lay emphasis on practical results. It is imperative to respect differences
among countries, especially developing countries, in domestic policies, capacity building and
economic structure. A one-size-fits-all approach must be avoided. Addressing climate change
should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve
their people's living Standards. Special needs of the developing countries must be well
attended to.

Dear colleagues,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The Paris Conference is not the finishing line but a new starting point. As an important part of
global governance, the global efforts on climate change can be taken as a mirror for us to
reflect on what models to have for future global governance and how to build a community of
shared future for mankind. Much valuable inspiration may thus be drawn.

- We should create a future of win-win cooperation, with each country making
contribution to the best of its ability. For global issues like climate change, a take-more-
give-less approach based on expediency is in nobody's interest. The Paris Conference should
reject the narrow-minded mentality of ""Zero sum game"" and call on all countries, the
developed countries in particular, to assume more shared responsibilities for win-win
outcomes.

- We should create a future of the rule of law, fairness and justice. It is imperative to
enhance the standing and role of international law in global governance, ensure effective
observance and implementation of international rules, uphold democracy, equity and justice,
 and build international rule of law. Given the difference between developed and developing
countries in historical responsibility, developing stage and coping capability, the principle of
common but differentiated responsibilities, instead of being obsolete, must continue to be
adhered to.

- We should create a future of inclusiveness, mutual learning and common
development. Facing global challenges, countries need to increase dialogue and exchange
best practices. We should draw on each other's strengths to achieve common development
through mutual learning, and deliver benefits to all our people. At the same time, we should
be prepared to accept harmony without uniformity, allowing individual countries to seek their
own solutions that best suit their respective national conditions.

Dear colleagues,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

China has been actively engaged in the global campaign on climate change. China is both
sincere and determined to contribute its share to the success of the Paris Conference.

In the past few decades, China has seen rapid economic growth and significant improvement
in people's lives. However, this has taken a toll on the environment and resources. Having
learned the lesson, China is vigorously making ecological endeavors to promote green,
circular and low-carbon growth. We have integrated our climate change efforts into China's
medium- and long-term program of economic and social development. We attach equal
importance to mitigation and adaption, and try to make progress on all fronts by resorting to
legal and administrative means, technologies and market forces. China's installed capacity of
renewable energy accounts for 24% of the world's total, with the newly installed capacity
accounting for 42% of the global total. China tops the world in terms of energy conservation
and utilization of new and renewable energies.

""All things live in harmony and grow with nourishments."" Chinese culture values harmony
between man and nature and respects nature. Going forward, ecological endeavors will
feature prominently in China's 13th Five-Year Plan. China will work hard to implement the
vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and inclusive development. China will, on the
basis of technological and institutional innovation, adopt new policy measures to improve
industrial mix, build low-carbon energy system, develop green building and low-carbon
transportation, and build a nation-wide carbon emission trading market so as to foster a new
pattern of modernization featuring harmony between man and nature. In its Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions, China pledges to peak CO2 emissions by around 2030
and strive to achieve it as soon as possible, and by 2030, reduce CO2 per unit of GDP by 60-
65% over the 2005 level, raise the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to
about 20% and increase forest stock by around 4.5 billion cubic meters over 2005. This
requires strenuous efforts, but we have confidence and resolve to fulfill our commitments.
China upholds the values of friendship, justice and shared interests, and takes an active part
in international cooperation on climate change. Over the years, the Chinese government has
earnestly fulfilled its policy commitments of South-South cooperation regarding climate
change to support developing countries, especially the least developed countries, landlocked
developing countries and small island developing states, in confronting the challenge of
climate change. In a show of greater support, China announced in September the
establishment of an RMB 20 billion South-South Climate Cooperation Fund. Next year, China
will launch cooperation projects to set up 10 pilot low-carbon industrial parks and start 100
mitigation and adaptation programs in other developing countries and provide them with
1,000 training opportunities on climate change. China will continue to promote international
cooperation in such areas as clean energy, disaster prevention and mitigation, ecological
protection, climate-smart agriculture, and low-carbon and smart cities. China will also help
other developing countries to increase their financing capacity.

Dear Colleagues,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now on Paris. Let us
join hands to contribute to the establishment of an equitable and effective global mechanism
on climate change, work for global sustainable development at a higher level and bring about
new international relations featuring win-win cooperation.
 Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Comrades and Friends,
In this golden season of autumn, we are gathered here to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. For the Chinese people of
all ethnic groups and Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad, this is a joyful moment - a moment to celebrate the 7Oth birthday of our great People's
Republic and to salute the epic progress of our motherland during the past seven decades.
Over the past 70 years, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people, with great courage and relentless exploration,
have successfully opened the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Along this path, we have ushered in a new era. Having caught up with the world in
great strides, we are now marching forward at the forefront of the times with boundless energy!
Over the past 70 years, the Chinese people, with perseverance and strenuous efforts, have made development achievements that are the marvel of the world.
Absolute poverty, which has haunted the Chinese nation for thousands of years, will soon become a thing of the past. This will be a great miracle in human
history!
Over the past 70 years, the Chinese people, upholding an independent foreign policy of peace, have forged ahead along the path of peaceful development.
Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we have deepened friendship and cooperation with other countries and made an important contribution to
building a community with a shared future for mankind and advancing the noble cause of peace and development for humanity!
Seventy years are but a fleeting moment in human history. But for the Chinese people, for our nation, these have been 70 years of epoch-making changes. The
Chinese nation has realized a tremendous transformation: it has stood up, grown rich and is becoming stronger; it has come to embrace the brilliant prospects of
national renewal. This phenomenal transformation brings infinite pride to every son and daughter of the Chinese nation!
Here on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, | pay high tribute to the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and all CPC members, to
officers and men of the People's Liberation Army and members of the armed police, and to all the other political parties and personages with no party affiliations
in China! | wish to convey sincere greetings to fellow Chinese in the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, in Taiwan and residing abroad! | also
wish to express heartfelt thanks to all the countries and international friends who have given support and help to the development of New China!
Comrades and Friends!

 22/01/2024, 12:06 Speech by Xi Jinping At the Reception in Celebration of the 70th Anniversary of The Founding of the People's Republic of China
Unity is iron and steel; unity is a source of strength. It is what has enabled the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to move forward against all risks and
challenges, from one victory to another.

In our new journey, we must hold high the banner of unity and rally closely around the CPC Central Committee. We must cement the great unity of all our ethnic
groups, and strengthen the great unity of all Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad and of all political parties, organizations, ethnic groups, social
strata and fronts. We must maintain the close bond between the CPC and the people and promote patriotism. Thus we will create an unparalleled force that will
power the ship of our national renewal to clip waves and reach its destination.
Comrades and Friends!
We will continue to fully and faithfully implement the principles of ""One Country, Two Systems"", ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"", ""Macao people
administering Macao"" and a high degree of autonomy. We will act in strict accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Laws. We are confident that with the
full backing of the motherland and the concerted efforts of our fellow Chinese in Hong Kong and Macao who love the motherland as well as their communities,
Hong Kong and Macao will prosper and progress alongside the mainland and embrace an even brighter future!
We will uphold the one-China principle and the ""1992 Consensus"", promote the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen cross-
Strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation to the benefit of people on both sides. The complete reunification of the motherland is an inevitable
trend; it is what the greater national interests entail and what all Chinese people aspire for. No one and no force can ever stop it!
We will hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and keep firmly to the path of peaceful development. We will stay
committed to opening-up and work with people in all countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind, and to create a world bathed in peace and
development.
Comrades and Friends,
The Chinese people are great people, the Chinese nation is a great nation, and Chinese civilization is a great civilization. History will shed light on the future, and
our journey ahead will be a long one. We are convinced that the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, with a proud civilization spanning over five millennia
and great accomplishments during the past 70-year history of New China, will write a more brilliant chapter in our new journey toward the realization of the Two
Centenary Goals and the Chinese Dream of great national renewal.
Now please join me in a toast:
To the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China;
To the prosperity and strength of China and the happiness and well-being of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups;
To the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and all other countries; and
To the health of all the guests, comrades and friends present.
Cheers!

Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China at the Conference Marking the 50th
Anniversary of the Restoration of the Lawful Seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations
2021-10-25 15:26
25 October 2021
Your Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
Your Excellencies Diplomatic Envoys and Representatives of International Organizations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
Comrades,
Fifty years ago today, the 26th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, and the
decision was made to restore all rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and to recognize the representatives of the Government of the
People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. It was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people
of the world.
Today, on this special date, we are here to review the past history and look to the future, and that makes our gathering all the more significant.
The restoration of New China's lawful seat in the United Nations was a momentous event for the world and the United Nations. It came as the result of joint
efforts of all peace-loving countries that stood up for justice in the world. It marked the return of the Chinese people, or one-fourth of the world's population, back
to the UN stage. The importance was significant and far-reaching for both China and the wider world.
On this occasion, | wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, heartfelt gratitude to all countries that co-sponsored and
supported UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and to pay high tribute to all countries and people that stand on the side of justice.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
Comrades,
The past five decades since New China restored its lawful seat in the United Nations have witnessed China's peaceful development and its commitment and
dedication to the welfare of all humanity.
- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have demonstrated an untiring spirit and kept to the right direction of China's development amidst changing
circumstances, thus writing an epic chapter in the development of China and humanity. Building on achievements in national construction and
development since the founding of New China, the Chinese people have started the new historical era of reform and opening-up, and successfully initiated and
developed socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have continued to unleash and develop productivity and raise living standards, and achieved a historic
breakthrough of leaping from a country with relatively low productivity to the second largest economy in the world. Through much hard work, the Chinese people
have attained the goal of fully building a moderately prosperous society on the vast land of China, and won the battle against poverty, thus securing a historic
success in eradicating absolute poverty. We have now embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country and opened up bright
prospects for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have stood in solidarity and cooperation with people around the world and upheld international equity and
justice, contributing significantly to world peace and development. The Chinese people are peace-loving people and know well the value of peace and
stability. We have unswervingly followed an independent foreign policy of peace, stood firm for fairness and justice, and resolutely opposed hegemony and
power politics. The Chinese people are a strong supporter of other developing countries in their just struggle to safeguard sovereignty, security and development
interests. The Chinese people are committed to achieving common development. From the Tazara Railway to the Belt and Road Initiative, we have done what
we could to help other developing countries, and have offered the world new opportunities through our own development. During the trying times of the COVID-
19 pandemic, China has been active in sharing COVID response experience with the world, and has sent large quantities of supplies, vaccines and medicines to
other countries, and deeply engaged in science-based cooperation on COVID-19 origins tracing, all in a sincere and proactive effort to contribute to humanity's
final victory over the pandemic.
- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have upheld the authority and sanctity of the United Nations and practiced multilateralism, and China's
cooperation with the United Nations has deepened steadily. China has faithfully fulfilled its responsibility and mission as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, stayed true to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upheld the central role of the United Nations in international affairs. China

has stood actively for political settlement of disputes through peaceful means. It has sent over 50,000 peacekeepers to UN peacekeeping operations, and is now
the second largest financial contributor to both the United Nations and UN peacekeeping operations. China has been among the first of countries to meet the UN
Millennium Development Goals. It has taken the lead in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, accounting for over 70 percent of global
poverty reduction. China has acted by the spirit of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and earnestly applied the universality of
human rights in the Chinese context. It has blazed a path of human rights development that is consistent with the trend of the times and carries distinct Chinese
features, thus making major contribution to human rights progress in China and the international human rights cause.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Friends,

Comrades,

The trend of the world, vast and mighty, prospers those who follow it and perishes those who go against it. Over the last 50 years, for all the vicissitudes in the
international landscape, the world has remained stable as a whole, thanks to the concerted efforts of people of all countries. The world economy has grown
rapidly, and innovation in science and technology has kept breaking new ground. A large number of developing countries have grown stronger, over a billion
people have walked out of poverty, and a population of several billion are moving toward modernization.

In the world today, changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and the force for peace, development and progress has continued to grow. It falls upon us to
follow the prevailing trend of history, and choose cooperation over confrontation, openness over seclusion, and mutual benefit over zero-sum games. We shall be
firm in opposing all forms of hegemony and power politics, as well as all forms of unilateralism and protectionism.

- We should vigorously advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and work
together to provide the right guiding philosophy for building a better world. Peace and development are our common cause, equity and justice our
common aspiration, and democracy and freedom our common pursuit. The world we live in is diverse and colorful. Diversity makes human civilization what it is,
and provides a constant source of vitality and driving force for world development. As a Chinese saying goes, ""Without achieving the good of one hundred
various schools, the uniqueness of one individual cannot be achieved."" No civilization in the world is superior to others; every civilization is special and unique to
its own region. Civilizations can achieve harmony only through communication, and can make progress only through harmonization. Whether a country's path of
development works is judged, first and foremost, by whether it fits the country's conditions; whether it follows the development trend of the times; whether it
brings about economic growth, social advancement, better livelinoods and social stability; whether it has the people's endorsement and support; and whether it
contributes to the progressive cause of humanity.

- We should jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and work together to build an open, inclusive, clean and
beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity. The human race is an integral community and Earth is our common
homeland. No person or country can thrive in isolation. Humanity should overcome difficulties in solidarity and pursue common development in harmony. We
should keep moving toward a community with a shared future for mankind, and jointly create a better future. To build a community with a shared future for
mankind is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and
levels of development coming together for shared interests, shared rights and shared responsibilities in global affairs, and creating the greatest synergy for
building a better world.

- We should stay committed to mutual benefit and win-win results, and work together to promote economic and social development for the greater
benefit of our people. As ancient Chinese observed, ""The essence of governance is livelihood, and the essence of livelihood is adequacy."" Development and
happy lives are the common aspirations of people in all countries. Development is meaningful only when it is for the people's interest, and can sustain only when
it is motivated by the people. Countries should put their people front and center, and strive to realize development with a higher level of quality, efficiency, equity,
sustainability and security. It is important to resolve the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development, and make development more balanced,
coordinated and inclusive. It is also important to strengthen the people's capacity for development, foster a development environment where everyone takes part
and has a share, and create a development paradigm where its outcome benefits every person in every country more directly and fairly. Not long ago, at the 76th
Session of the UN General Assembly, | proposed a Global Development Initiative, with the hope that countries will work together to overcome impacts of COVID-
19 on global development, accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build a global community of development with a
shared future.

- We should step up cooperation, and work together to address the various challenges and global issues facing humanity. The international community
is confronted by regional disputes as well as global issues such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity. Only with more inclusive global
governance, more effective multilateral mechanisms and more active regional cooperation, can these issues be addressed effectively. Climate change is
Nature's alarm bell to humanity. Countries need to take concrete actions to protect Mother Nature. We need to encourage green recovery, green production and
green consumption, promote a civilized and healthy way of life, foster harmony between man and Nature, and let a sound ecology and environment be the
inexhaustible source of sustainable development.

- We should resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the United Nations, and work together to practice true multilateralism. Building a
community with a shared future for mankind requires a strong United Nations and reform and development of the global governance system. Countries should
uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms of international
relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. International rules can only be made by the 193 UN Member States together, and not decided
by individual countries or blocs of countries. International rules should be observed by the 193 UN Member States, and there is no and should be no exception.
Countries should respect the United Nations, take good care of the UN family, refrain from exploiting the Organization, still less abandoning it at one's will, and
make sure that the United Nations plays an even more positive role in advancing humanity's noble cause of peace and development. China will be happy to work
with all countries under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to explore new ideas and new models of cooperation and
keep enriching the practice of multilateralism under new circumstances.

 22/01/2024, 10:33 Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China at the Conference Marking the 50th Anniversary of the Restoration ...
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
Comrades,
A review of the past can light the way forward. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and
always be a builder of world peace. China will stay committed to the path of reform and opening-up and always be a contributor to global development. China will
stay committed to the path of multilateralism and always be a defender of the international order.
As an ancient Chinese poem reads, ""Green hills immerse in the same cloud and rain. The same moon lights up towns however far away."" Let us join hands,
stand on the right side of history and the side of human progress, and work tirelessly for the lasting and peaceful development of the world and for building a
community with a shared future for mankind!
Thank you.

The following is the full text of the speech:
Speech at the first session of the 14th NPC
March 13, 2023
By Xi Jinping
Fellow deputies,
| was elected at this session to continue to serve as the president of
the People's Republic of China (PRC). | would like to express my
heartfelt gratitude for the trust placed in me by all the deputies and
the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.
It is my third time to take on this noble position of the president of the
PRC. The people's trust has been my greatest source of strength to
go forward and also the greatest responsibility on my shoulders. | will
faithfully fulfill the duties prescribed in the Constitution, take the needs
of the country as my mission and the people's interests as the
yardstick to follow, be committed and honest in my duties, devote =)
 myself to my work without reserve, and never fail to live up to the
great trust of the deputies and the people.
Fellow deputies,
The Chinese nation, with a civilization spanning over 5,000 years, has
created a myriad of glories and also been through a lot of hardships
and adversity. With the advent of modern times, China was reduced
to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, when bullying by foreign
powers and frequent wars tore the country apart and plunged the
Chinese people into an abyss of great suffering. Since its founding,
the Communist Party of China (CPC) has closely united and led the
Chinese people of all ethnic groups in working hard for a century to
put an end to China's national humiliation. The Chinese people have
become the masters of their future, the Chinese nation has achieved
the great transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to
becoming strong, and China's national rejuvenation has become a
historical inevitability.
From now until the middle of the century, the central task of the Party
and all Chinese people is to complete building China into a great
modern socialist country in all respects and advance national
rejuvenation on all fronts. And the baton of this central task has now
been historically passed on to our generation. In accordance with the
strategic plans made at the 20th CPC National Congress, we must
implement the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged
Comprehensive Strategy, soeed up Chinese modernization, strive in
unity, and continue to break new ground, so as to make achievements
on the new journey that answer the call of our times and history and
meet the expectations of our people, and make due contributions of
our generation to building a great country and achieving national
rejuvenation.
Fellow deputies,

a
 On the new journey to build China into a great country and to achieve
national rejuvenation, we must unswervingly promote high-quality
development. We must fully and faithfully apply the new development
philosophy on all fronts and accelerate the efforts to foster a new
development pattern. We must fully implement the strategy for
invigorating China through science and education, the workforce
development strategy and the innovation-driven development
strategy, and focus on achieving greater self-reliance and strength in
science and technology. We must also promote transformation and
upgrading of industries, promote coordinated urban-rural and regional
development, make further efforts to build a green and low-carbon
economy and society, and effectively upgrade the quality and
appropriately expand the output of our economy, so as to constantly
increase our economic strength, scientific and technological
capabilities and composite national strength.

We must remain committed to putting the people first. The people are
the decisive force for building China into a great modern socialist
country in all respects. We must proactively develop whole-process
people's democracy, uphold the unity between the Party leadership,
the running of the country by the people and law-based governance,
improve the system of institutions through which the people run the
country, fulfill the people's will, protect their rights and interests and
fully inspire their enthusiasm, initiative and creativity. We need to
implement a people-centered philosophy of development, improve the
system of income distribution, perfect the social security system, and
enhance basic public services. We must ensure that the basic living
needs of all our people are met, and work hard to resolve the
pressing difficulties and problems that concern them most. We must
do a better job of seeing to it that the gains of modernization benefit
all our people fairly, and make more notable and substantive progress
in promoting common prosperity for all. We must strengthen the great
unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the great unity
all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation at home and abrodiia)
 thus mobilizing all positive factors to give shape to a mighty joint force
for building a great country and advancing the rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation.

We need to better coordinate development and security. Security is
the foundation of development and stability is the prerequisite for
prosperity. We must resolutely pursue a holistic approach to national
security, improve the national security system, strengthen our
capacity for safeguarding national security, enhance public security
governance, and improve the social governance system. With this
new security architecture, we will be able to better safeguard China's
new pattern of development. We should comprehensively promote
the modernization of our national defense and our armed forces, and
build the people's military into a great wall of steel that can effectively
safeguard our nation's sovereignty, security and the interests of our
development.

We should solidly promote the practice of ""one country, two systems""
and the great cause of national reunification. The long-term prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions
is indispensable to the building of a great China. We should fully,
faithfully, and resolutely implement the policy of ""one country, two
systems,"" under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong
Kong and the people of Macao administer Macao, both with a high
degree of autonomy. We will remain committed to law-based
governance in Hong Kong and Macao and will support Hong Kong
and Macao in developing their economies and improving people's
livelihood, so that they can better integrate themselves into the overall
development of the country. Realizing China's complete reunification
is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese
nation as well as the essence of national rejuvenation. We should
implement the Party's overall policy for resolving the Taiwan question
in the new era, uphold the one-China principle and the 1992
Consensus, actively promote the peaceful development of cross-
strait relations, resolutely oppose foreign interference and separatism
 activities aimed at ""Taiwan independence,” and unswervingly promote
progress towards national reunification.

We must strive to promote the building of a community with a shared
future for mankind. China's development benefits the world, and
China cannot develop itself in isolation from the world. We must
solidly promote high-level opening up, not only making good use of
the global market and resources to develop ourselves, but also
promoting common development of the world. We must hold high the
banner of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit,
always stand on the right side of history, practice true multilateralism
and the common values of mankind, actively participate in the reform
and development of the global governance system, and promote the
development of an open world economy. We should promote the
implementation of Global Development Initiative and Global Security
Initiative, so as to add more stability and positive energy to world
peace and development, and create a favorable international
environment for our country's development.

Fellow deputies,

To do a good job of governing the country, the Party should do a good
job of governing itself; and to build a great country, the Party must be
thriving. To promote the building of a great country, it is essential to
uphold the leadership of the CPC and the centralized, unified
leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and to step up Party
building in a solid manner. We must remain sober-minded and
resolved about addressing the challenges unique to a big political
party as ours, and have the courage to carry out self-reform. We must
unceasingly exercise full and rigorous Party self-governance,
unswervingly fight against corruption, and always maintain the unity
and solidarity of the Party. By doing so, we will be able to ensure that
the Party will never change its nature, its conviction, or its character,
which will serve as a strong guarantee for building a great country
and advancing national rejuvenation. [=]
 Fellow deputies,
The grand goal of building a great country and achieving national
rejuvenation is encouraging and motivating. We should seize the day,
remain confident in our history, exhibit greater historical initiative,
uphold fundamental principles and break new ground, maintain
strategic resolve, carry forward the fighting spirit, and strive to
overcome all difficulties, to contribute to the great cause of building
China into a great country and achieving national rejuvenation.
Thank you.

Text of President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address
Jan. 28, 2003
Courtesy eMediaMillWorks
Following is the text of the 2003 State of the Union address, which President Bush delivered
to a nationally televised joint session of Congress.
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished citizens and
fellow citizens, every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the
union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.
You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress,
we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country, we have the opportunity
to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is
broadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the
American people.
(APPLAUSE)
In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. During the last two
years we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together.
To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform which
must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom so that every child in
American can read and learn and succeed in life.
(APPLAUSE)
To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of
Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era.
To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation.
(APPLAUSE)
To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms, and we are holding
corporate criminals to account.
(APPLAUSE)
Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and the
Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens.
Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every
man and woman who seeks a job.
(APPLAUSE)
After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and stock market declines, our economy
is recovering. Yet it is not growing fast enough, or strongly enough.
With unemployment rising, our nation needs more small businesses to open, more
companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, *‘Help
Wanted.""
(APPLAUSE)
Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more
money to spend and invest; and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that
money is not to tax it away in the first place.
(APPLAUSE)
I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent
and effective this year.
(APPLAUSE)
And under my plan, as soon as I've signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in
workers' paychecks.
Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now.
(APPLAUSE)

https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803 html 2/11
 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American
families now.
(APPLAUSE) This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help our
economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep this year an average of
almost $1,100 more of their own money. A family of four with an income of $40,000 would
see their federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year.
(APPLAUSE)
And our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.
You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future
years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three or five or seven years from now, it is
even better for Americans today.
(APPLAUSE)
We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It's fair
to tax a company's profits. It 1s not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits.
(APPLAUSE)
To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend
income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends.
(APPLAUSE) Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More
jobs mean more taxpayers and higher revenues to our government.
The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage
economic growth and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C.
(APPLAUSE) We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send
you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, about as much as
the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us:
Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.
(APPLAUSE)
A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the future of Social
Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we
must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control
and they will own.
(APPLAUSE)
Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans.
(APPLAUSE)
The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of
discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too
much, and many have no coverage at all.
These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates
coverage and rations care.
(APPLAUSE)
Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance
policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help
they need.
(APPLAUSE)
Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and
patients back in charge of American medicine.
(APPLAUSE)
Health care reform must begin with Medicare; Medicare is the binding commitment of a
caring society.
(APPLAUSE)

https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803 html 3/11
 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and
new drugs that are transforming health care in America.
Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just
the way it is.
(APPLAUSE)
And just like you, the members of Congress, and your staffs and other federal employees, all
seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs.
(APPLAUSE) My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to
reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about
strengthening Medicare. I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.
(APPLAUSE)
To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost:
the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued.
(APPLAUSE)
Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and many parts of
America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; I urge
the Congress to pass medical liability reform.
(APPLAUSE)
Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically
improving the environment.
(APPLAUSE)
I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation,
to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home.
(APPLAUSE)
I have sent you clear skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from
power plants over the next 15 years.
(APPLAUSE)
I have sent you a healthy forest initiative to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate
communities, kill wildlife and burn away millions of acres of treasured forests.
(APPLAUSE)
I urge you to pass these measures for the good of both our environment and our economy.
(APPLAUSE)
Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that
generations before us could not have imagined.
In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless
lawsuits or command-and-control regulations, but through technology and innovation.
Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in
developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.
(APPLAUSE)
A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be
used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national
commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from
laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered
by hydrogen, and pollution-free.
(APPLAUSE)
Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country
much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.
(APPLAUSE)

 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America.
For so many in our country--the homeless, and the fatherless, the addicted--the need is great.
Yet there is power--wonder-working power--in the goodness and idealism and faith of the
American people.

Americans are doing the work of compassion every day: visiting prisoners, providing shelter
for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve
our praise, they deserve our personal support and, when appropriate, they deserve the
assistance of the federal government.

(APPLAUSE)

I urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act to encourage
acts of compassion that can transform America one heart and one soul at a time.
(APPLAUSE)

Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps, which is
enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America.

Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the
resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens: boys and
girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through
a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.

I propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged
junior high students and children of prisoners.

Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women
of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person, can change a life forever, and I
urge you to be that one person.

(APPLAUSE)

Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship,
ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire.
As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand
through anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs
is a fight for their own lives.

Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new $600
million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next
three years.

(APPLAUSE)

Our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at
the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, ‘God
does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you.""

Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of
hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.

(APPLAUSE) By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women
who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values every
life.

And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at
the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion.

(APPLAUSE)

And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask
you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning.
(APPLAUSE)

The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our
conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our
founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person and
the possibilities of every life.

 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and
confound the designs of evil men.

In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people, and we will continue helping
them secure their country, rebuild their society and educate all their children, boys and girls.
(APPLAUSE)

In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic
Palestine.

(APPLAUSE)

Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry. More than 60 percent of international food
aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States.

As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also
remember our calling, as a blessed country, is to make the world better.

Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus, including 3
million children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than
one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million require
immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims--only
50,000--are receiving the medicine they need.

Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment.
Almost all who do are turned away.

A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, *‘We have no medicines,
many hospitals tell people, 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die’."" In an
age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.

(APPLAUSE)

AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of
those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year, which places a
tremendous possibility within our grasp.

Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so
many. We have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country.
And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of
Africa.

This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million
people with life-extending drugs and provide humane care for millions of people suffering
from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDS.

I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10
billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa
and the Caribbean.

(APPLAUSE)

This nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature.

And this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of
international terrorism.

(APPLAUSE)

There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror. There's
never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress
or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on,
and we are winning.

(APPLAUSE)

To date we have arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaeda. They
include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks, the
chief of Al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our
embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole, an Al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast
Asia, a former director of Al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaeda
operative in Europe, a major Al Qaeda leader in Yemen.

 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries.
And many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: They are no longer a
problem to the United States and our friends and allies.
(APPLAUSE)
We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition
countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the embassy in Yemen,
the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz
and the Straits of Gibraltar. We've broken Al Qaeda cells in Hamburg and Milan and Madrid
and London and Paris--as well as Buffalo, New York.
We've got the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one the terrorists
are learning the meaning of American justice.
(APPLAUSE)
As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: here, in our own country. This
government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our
homeland.
We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly
trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against
smallpox, and are deploying the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect
biological attack.
And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation
against ballistic missiles.
(APPLAUSE)
I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future
security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio-
terrorism, called Project Bioshield.
The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective
vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, ebola and plague. We
must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before
the dangers are upon us.
(APPLAUSE)
Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more
closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to
analyze intelligence, and is transforming itself to meet new threats.
Tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security and the
Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and
analyze all threat information in a single location.
Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make
sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens.
(APPLAUSE)
Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two
towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a
pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle and
whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the trrumph of violence in the affairs of men;
free people will set the course of history.
(APPLAUSE)
Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the
world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror and mass murder. They could
also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least
hesitation.
This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of
men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the
weak and intimidate the world.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803 html 7/11
 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions
of Hitlerism, militarism and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the
strength of great alliances and by the might of the United States of America.
(APPLAUSE)
Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to
gain the ultimate weapons of terror.
Once again, this nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a
world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our
people and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.
(APPLAUSE)
America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called
on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We are
strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and
control nuclear materials around the world. We are working with other governments to
secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning
the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.
In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process. It is to
achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world.
All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks, and we're asking
them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the
decisions of others.
(APPLAUSE)
Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and
security of the American people.
(APPLAUSE)
Different threats require different strategies. In Iran we continue to see a government that
represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction and supports terror.
We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and
human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own
government, and determine their own destiny, and the United States supports their
aspirations to live in freedom.
(APPLAUSE)
On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation.
Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North
Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the
world and developing those weapons all along.
And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek
concessions.
America and the world will not be blackmailed.
(APPLAUSE)
America is working with the countries of the region--South Korea, Japan, China and Russia-
-to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons
will bring only isolation, economic stagnation and continued hardship.
(APPLAUSE)
The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when
it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.
(APPLAUSE)
Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an
even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression,
with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth will not be permitted to dominate a vital
region and threaten the United States.
(APPLAUSE)

 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he
had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass
destruction.

For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country.

Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons: not economic
sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his
military facilities.

Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his
final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for
the opinion of the world.

The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct--were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for
hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify
that Iraq's regime is disarming.

It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out
for the world to see and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened. The
United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materials
sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax; enough doses to kill several million
people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has
destroyed it.

The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce
more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin; enough to subject millions of people to death by
respiratory failure. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has
destroyed it.

Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as
much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical
agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given
no evidence that he has destroyed them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had
upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently
turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam
Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He has
given no evidence that he has destroyed them.

From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile
biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be
moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these
facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.

The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had
an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and
was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.

The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant
quantities of uranium from Africa.

Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum
tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.

Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.
The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving.

From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel
are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection
sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves.

Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-
2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations.

Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview.
Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.

Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate
with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.

Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken
great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible

https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/bushtext_012803 html 9/11
 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate,
intimidate or attack.

With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein

could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that

region.

And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from

intelligence sources, secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal

that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda. Secretly,

and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help

them develop their own.

Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be

contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily

contained.

Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans, this time armed by Saddam

Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a

day of horror like none we have ever known.

We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes.

(APPLAUSE)

Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and

tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?

If this threat 1s permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words and all

recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein

is not a strategy, and it is not an option.

(APPLAUSE)

The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them

on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind or disfigured.

Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained: by torturing children while their

parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods

used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on

the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape.

If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.

(APPLAUSE)

And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not

surrounding your country, your enemy is ruling your country.

(APPLAUSE)

And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.

(APPLAUSE)

The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and

mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies.

The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to

consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will

present information and intelligence about Iraqi's--Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its

attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors and its links to terrorist groups.

We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully

disarm for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to

disarm him.

(APPLAUSE)

Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the

American armed forces. Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some

crucial hours may lay ahead.

In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you.

Your honor will guide you. You believe in America and America believes in you.

 22/01/2024, 15:00 President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address | Jan. 28, 2003 (washingtonpost.com)
(APPLAUSE) Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can
make. The technologies of war have changed. The risks and suffering of war have not.
For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This nation fights
reluctantly, because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come.
We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived
at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all.
If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in every
way we can, the innocent.
And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States
military, and we will prevail.
(APPLAUSE) And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring
to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.
(APPLAUSE)
Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years,
America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter
division in small matters to calm unity in great causes.
And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right
country.
Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has
revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves.
America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power
without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.
Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the
future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift
to humanity.
(APPLAUSE)
We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to know
all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving
god behind all of life and all of history. May he guide us now, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
Thank you.

Remarks to the Plenary Session of the United Nations General Assembly

Video link: (http://www.un.org/webcast/summit2005/statements14.html)

Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the privilege of being here for
the 60th anniversary of the United Nations. Thank you for your dedication to the vital work and great ideals of this institution.
We meet at a time of great challenge for America and the world. At this moment, men and women along my country's gulf
coast are recovering from one of the worst natural disasters in American history. Many have lost homes and loved ones and
all their earthly possessions. In Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana, whole neighborhoods have been lifted from their
foundations and sent crashing into the streets. A great American city is working to turn the flood waters and reclaim its future.
We have witnessed the awesome power of nature and the greater power of human compassion. Americans have responded
to their neighbors in need, and so have many of the nations represented in this chamber. All together, more than 115
countries and nearly a dozen international organizations have stepped forward with offers of assistance. To every nation,
every province, and every community across the world that is standing with the American people in this hour of need, | offer
the thanks of my nation.

Your response, like the response to last year's tsunami, has shown once again that the world is more compassionate and
hopeful when we act together. This truth was the inspiration for the United Nations. The U.N.'s founding members laid out
great and honorable goals in the charter they drafted six decades ago. That document commits this organization to work to
“save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,"" ""reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,"" and ""promote social
progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."" We remain committed to those noble ideals. As we respond to great
humanitarian needs, we must actively respond to the other great challenges of our time. We must continue to work to ease
suffering and to spread freedom and to lay the foundations of lasting peace for our children and grandchildren.

In this young century, the far corners of the world are linked more closely than ever before, and no nation can remain isolated
and indifferent to the struggles of others. When a country or a region is filled with despair and resentment and vulnerable to
violent and aggressive ideologies, the threat passes easily across oceans and borders and could threaten the security of any
peaceful country.

 22/01/2024, 16:07 Address to the United Nations General Assembly by President George W. Bush

Terrorism fed by anger and despair has come to Tunisia, to Indonesia, to Kenya, to Tanzania, to Morocco, to Israel, to Saudi
Arabia, to the United States, to Turkey, to Spain, to Russia, to Egypt, to Iraq, and the United Kingdom. And those who have
not seen attacks on their own soil have still shared in the sorrow, from Australians killed in Bali to Italians killed in Egypt, to the
citizens of dozens of nations who were killed on September the 11th, 2001, here in the city where we meet. The lesson is
clear: There can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others.
Either hope will spread or violence will spread, and we must take the side of hope.

Sometimes our security will require confronting threats directly, and so a great coalition of nations has come together to fight
the terrorists across the world. We've worked together to help break up terrorist networks that cross borders and rout out
radical cells within our own borders. We've eliminated terrorist sanctuaries. We're using our diplomatic and financial tools to
cut off their financing and drain them of support. And as we fight, the terrorists must know the world stands united against
them. We must complete the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that will put every nation on record: The
targeting and deliberate killing by terrorists of civilians and non-combatants cannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or
grievance.

And the world's free nations are determined to stop the terrorists and their allies from acquiring the terrible weapons that
would allow them to kill on a scale equal to their hatred. For that reason, more than 60 countries are supporting the
Proliferation Security Initiative to intercept shipments of weapons of mass destruction on land, on sea, and at air. The
terrorists must know that wherever they go, they cannot escape justice.

Later today, the Security Council has an opportunity to put the terrorists on notice when it votes on a resolution that
condemns the incitement of terrorist acts, the resolution that calls upon all states to take appropriate steps to end such
incitement. We also need to sign and implement the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism
so that all those who seek radioactive materials or nuclear devices are prosecuted and extradited, wherever they are. We
must send a clear message to the rulers of outlaw regimes that sponsor terror and pursue weapons of mass murder: You will
not be allowed to threaten the peace and stability of the world.

Confronting our enemies is essential, and so civilized nations will continue to take the fight to the terrorists. Yet we know that
this war will not be won by force of arms alone. We must defeat the terrorists on the battlefield, and we must also defeat them
in the battle of ideas. We must change the conditions that allow terrorists to flourish and recruit, by spreading the hope of
freedom to millions who've never known it. We must help raise up the failing states and stagnant societies that provide fertile
ground for the terrorists. We must defend and extend a vision of human dignity and opportunity and prosperity, a vision far
stronger than the dark appeal of resentment and murder.

To spread a vision of hope, the United States is determined to help nations that are struggling with poverty. We are committed
to the Millennium Development goals. This is an ambitious agenda that includes cutting poverty and hunger in half, ensuring
that every boy and girl in the world has access to primary education, and halting the spread of AIDS—all by 2015.

We have a moral obligation to help others and a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective. At Monterrey in 2002, we
agreed to a new vision for the way we fight poverty and curb corruption and provide aid in this new millennium. Developing
countries agreed to take responsibility for their own economic progress through good governance and sound policies and the
rule of law. Developed countries agreed to support those efforts, including increased aid to nations that undertake necessary
reforms. My own country has sought to implement the Monterrey Consensus by establishing the new Millennium Challenge
Account. This account is increasing U.S. aid for countries that govern justly, invest in their people, and promote economic
freedom.

More needs to be done. | call on all the world's nations to implement the Monterrey Consensus. Implementing the Monterrey
Consensus means continuing on the long, hard road to reform. Implementing the Monterrey Consensus means creating a
genuine partnership between developed and developing countries to replace the donor-client relationship of the past. And
implementing the Monterrey Consensus means welcoming all developing countries as full participants to the global economy,
with all the requisite benefits and responsibilities.

 22/01/2024, 16:07 Address to the United Nations General Assembly by President George W. Bush

Tying aid to reform is essential to eliminating poverty, but our work doesn't end there. For many countries, AIDS, malaria, and
other diseases are both humanitarian tragedies and significant obstacles to development. We must give poor countries
access to the emergency lifesaving drugs they need to fight these infectious diseases. Through our bilateral programs and the
Global Fund, the United States will continue to lead the world in providing the resources to defeat the plague of HIV/ AIDS.
Today, America is working with local authorities and organizations in the largest initiative in history to combat a specific
disease. Across Africa, we're helping local health officials expand AIDS testing facilities, train and support doctors and nurses
and counselors, and upgrade clinics and hospitals. Working with our African partners, we have now delivered lifesaving
treatment to more than 230,000 people in sub-Sahara Africa. We are ahead of schedule to meet an important objective,
providing HIV/AIDS treatment for nearly 2 million adults and children in Africa. At the G-8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, we
set a clear goal, an AlIDS-free generation in Africa. | challenge every member of the United Nations to take concrete steps to
achieve that goal.

We're also working to fight malaria. This preventable disease kills more than a million people around the world every year and
leaves poverty and grief in every land it touches. The United States has set a goal of cutting the malaria death rate in half in at
least 15 highly endemic African countries. To achieve that goal, we've pledged to increase our funding for malaria treatment
and prevention by more than $1.2 billion over the next 5 years. We invite other nations to join us in this effort by committing
specific aid to the dozens of other African nations in need of it. Together we can fight malaria and save hundreds of
thousands of lives and bring new hope to countries that have been devastated by this terrible disease.

As we strengthen our commitment to fighting malaria and AIDS, we must also remain on the offensive against new threats to
public health such as the avian influenza. If left unchallenged, this virus could become the first pandemic of the 21st century.
We must not allow that to happen. Today | am announcing a new International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.
The Partnership requires countries that face an outbreak to immediately share information and provide samples to the World
Health Organization. By requiring transparency, we can respond more rapidly to dangerous outbreaks and stop them on time.
Many nations have already joined this partnership. We invite all nations to participate. It's essential we work together, and as
we do so, we will fulfill a moral duty to protect our citizens and heal the sick and comfort the afflicted.

Even with increased aid to fight disease and reform economies, many nations are held back by another heavy challenge, the
burden of debt. So America and many nations have also acted to lift this burden that limits the growth of developing
economies and holds millions of people in poverty. Today, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens are receiving more
than $30 billion in debt relief. And to prevent the build-up of future debt, my country and other nations have agreed that
international financial institutions should increasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans. The G-8 agreed
at Gleneagles to go further. To break the lend-and-forgive cycle permanently, we agreed to cancel 100 percent of the debt for
the world's most heavily indebted nations. | call upon the World Bank and the IMF to finalize this historic agreement as soon
as possible.

We will fight to lift the burden of poverty from places of suffering, not just for the moment but permanently. And the surest
path to greater wealth is greater trade. In a letter he wrote to me in August, the Secretary-General commended the G-8's
work but told me that aid and debt relief are not enough. The Secretary-General said that we also need to reduce trade
barriers and subsidies that are holding developing countries back. | agree with the Secretary-General: The Doha round is ""the
most promising way"" to achieve this goal.

A successful Doha round will reduce and eliminate tariffs and other barriers on farm and industrial goods. It will end unfair
agricultural subsidies. It will open up global markets for services. Under Doha, every nation will gain, and the developing
world stands to gain the most. Historically, developing nations that open themselves up to trade grow at several times the
rate of other countries. The elimination of trade barriers could lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the next
15 years. The stakes are high. The lives and futures of millions of the world's poorest citizens hang in the balance, and so we
must bring the Doha trade talks to a successful conclusion.

 22/01/2024, 16:07 Address to the United Nations General Assembly by President George W. Bush

Doha is an important step toward a larger goal. We must tear down the walls that separate the developed and developing
worlds. We need to give the citizens of the poorest nations the same ability to access the world economy that the people of
wealthy nations have, so they can offer their goods and talents on the world market alongside everyone else. We need to
ensure that they have the same opportunities to pursue their dreams, provide for their families, and live lives of dignity and
self-reliance.

And the greatest obstacles to achieving these goals are the tariffs and subsidies and barriers that isolate people of developing
nations from the great opportunities of the 21st century. Today, | reiterate the challenge | have made before: We must work
together in the Doha negotiations to eliminate agricultural subsidies that distort trade and stunt development and to eliminate
tariffs and other barriers to open markets for farmers around the world. Today | broaden the challenge by making this pledge:
The United States is ready to eliminate all tariffs, subsidies, and other barriers to free flow of goods and services as other
nations do the same. This is key to overcoming poverty in the world's poorest nations. It's essential we promote prosperity
and opportunity for all nations.

By expanding trade, we spread hope and opportunity to the corners of the world, and we strike a blow against the terrorists
who feed on anger and resentment. Our agenda for freer trade is part of our agenda for a freer world, where people can live
and worship and raise their children as they choose. In the long run, the best way to protect the religious freedom and the
rights of women and minorities is through institutions of self-rule, which allow people to assert and defend their own rights. All
who stand for human rights must also stand for human freedom.

This is a moment of great opportunity in the cause of freedom. Across the world, hearts and minds are opening to the
message of human liberty as never before. In the last 2 years alone, tens of millions have voted in free elections in
Afghanistan and Iraq, in Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories, in Kyrgyzstan, in Ukraine, and Georgia. And as they claim
their freedom, they are inspiring millions more across the broader Middle East. We must encourage their aspirations. We must
nurture freedom's progress, and the United Nations has a vital role to play.

Through the new U.N. Democracy Fund, the democratic members of the U.N. will work to help others who want to join the
democratic world. It is fitting that the world's largest democracy, India, has taken a leadership role in this effort, pledging $10
million to get the fund started. Every free nation has an interest in the success of this fund, and every free nation has a
responsibility in advancing the cause of liberty.

The work of democracy is larger than holding a fair election. It requires building the institutions that sustain freedom.
Democracy takes different forms in different cultures, yet all free societies have certain things in common. Democratic nations
uphold the rule of law, impose limits on the power of the state, treat women and minorities as full citizens. Democratic nations
protect private property, free speech, and religious expression. Democratic nations grow in strength because they reward and
respect the creative gifts of their people. And democratic nations contribute to peace and stability because they seek national
greatness in achievements of their citizens, not the conquest of their neighbors.

For these reasons, the whole world has a vital interest in the success of a free Iraq, and no civilized nation has an interest in
seeing a new terrorist state emerge in that country. So the free world is working together to help the Iraqi people to establish
a new nation that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself. It's an exciting opportunity for all of us in this chamber.
And the United Nations has played a vital role in the success of the January elections, where 8 1/2 million lragis defied the
terrorists and cast their ballots. And since then, the United Nations has supported Iraq's elected leaders as they drafted a
new constitution.

The United Nations and its member states must continue to stand by the Iraqi people as they complete the journey to a fully
constitutional government. And when Iraqis complete their journey, their success will inspire others to claim their freedom; the
Middle East will grow in peace and hope and liberty; and all of us will live in a safer world.

 22/01/2024, 16:07 Address to the United Nations General Assembly by President George W. Bush

The advance of freedom and security is the calling of our time. It is the mission of the United Nations. The United Nations was
created to spread the hope of liberty and to fight poverty and disease and to help secure human rights and human dignity for
all the world's people. To help make these promises real, the United Nations must be strong and efficient, free of corruption,
and accountable to the people it serves. The United Nations must stand for integrity and live by the high standards it sets for
others. And meaningful institutional reforms must include measures to improve internal oversight, identify cost savings, and
ensure that precious resources are used for their intended purpose.

The United Nations has taken the first steps toward reform. The process will continue in the General Assembly this fall, and
the United States will join with others to lead the effort. And the process of reform begins with members taking our
responsibilities seriously. When this great institution's member states choose notorious abusers of human rights to sit on the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, they discredit a noble effort and undermine the credibility of the whole organization. If
member countries want the United Nations to be respected —respected and effective, they should begin by making sure it is
worthy of respect.

At the start of a new century, the world needs the United Nations to live up to its ideals and fulfill its mission. The founding
members of this organization knew that the security of the world would increasingly depend on advancing the rights of
mankind, and this would require the work of many hands. After committing America to the idea of the U.N. in 1945, President
Franklin Roosevelt declared: ""The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man or one party or one nation."" Peace
is the responsibility of every nation and every generation.

In each era of history, the human spirit has been challenged by the forces of darkness and chaos. Some challenges are the
acts of nature; others are the works of man. This organization was convened to meet these challenges by harnessing the best
instincts of humankind, the strength of the world united in common purpose.

With courage and conscience, we will meet our responsibilities to protect the lives and rights of others. And when we do, we
will help fulfill the promise of the United Nations and ensure that every human being enjoys the peace and the freedom and
the dignity our Creator intended for all. Thank you.

President Bush's Speech to the Nation on the Economic
Crisis
Sept. 24, 2008
Following ts a transcript of President Bush's address to the nation Wednesday evening, as
recorded by by CQ Transcriptions:
Good evening. This is an extraordinary period for America's economy.
Over the past few weeks, many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and
their future. I understand their worry and their frustration.
We've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market. Major financial institutions have
teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainty has grown, many
banks have restricted lending, credit markets have frozen, and families and businesses
have found it harder to borrow money.
We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, and the federal government is responding
with decisive action.
We boosted confidence in money market mutual funds and acted to prevent major
investors from intentionally driving down stocks for their own personal gain.
Most importantly, my administration is working with Congress to address the root cause
behind much of the instability in our markets.
Financial assets related to home mortgages have lost value during the house decline, and
the banks holding these assets have restricted credit. As a result, our entire economy is in
danger.
So I propose that the federal government reduce the risk posed by these troubled assets
and supply urgently needed money so banks and other financial institutions can avoid
collapse and resume lending.
This rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry. It is
aimed at preserving America's overall economy.
It will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and
create jobs. And it will help send a signal to markets around the world that America's
financial system is back on track.

 22/01/2024, 17:17 President Bush’s Speech to the Nation on the Economic Crisis - The New York Times

I know many Americans have questions tonight: How did we reach this point in our
economy? How will the solution I propose work? And what does this mean for your
financial future?

These are good questions, and they deserve clear answers.

First, how did our economy reach this point? Well, most economists agree that the
problems we're witnessing today developed over a long period of time. For more than a
decade, a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad
because our country is an attractive and secure place to do business.

This large influx of money to U.S. banks and financial institutions, along with low interest
rates, made it easier for Americans to get credit. These developments allowed more
families to borrow money for cars, and homes, and college tuition, some for the first time.
They allowed more entrepreneurs to get loans to start new businesses and create jobs.
Unfortunately, there were also Some Serious negative consequences, particularly in the
housing market. Easy credit, combined with the faulty assumption that home values
would continue to rise, led to excesses and bad decisions.

Many mortgage lenders approved loans for borrowers without carefully examining their
ability to pay. Many borrowers took out loans larger than they could afford, assuming that
they could sell or refinance their homes at a higher price later on.

Optimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Eventually, the
number of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with
supply exceeding demand, housing prices fell, and this created a problem.

BUSH: Borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages, who had been planning to sell or
refinance their homes at a higher price, were stuck with homes worth less than expected,
along with mortgage payments they could not afford.

AS aresult, many mortgage-holders began to default. These widespread defaults had
effects far beyond the housing market.

See, in today's mortgage industry, home loans are often packaged together and converted
into financial products called mortgage-backed securities. These securities were sold to
investors around the world.

Many investors assumed these securities were trustworthy and asked few questions
about their actual value. Two of the leading purchasers of mortgage-backed securities
were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Because these companies were chartered by Congress, many believed they were
guaranteed by the federal government. This allowed them to borrow enormous sums of
money, fuel the market for questionable investments, and put our financial system at risk.

 22/01/2024, 17:17 President Bush’s Speech to the Nation on the Economic Crisis - The New York Times

The decline in the housing market set off a domino effect across our economy. When
home values declined, borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, and investors holding
mortgage-backed securities began to incur serious losses.

Before long, these securities became so unreliable that they were not being bought or
sold. Investment banks, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, found themselves
saddled with large amounts of assets they could not sell. They ran out of money needed to
meet their immediate obligations, and they faced imminent collapse.

Other banks found themselves in severe financial trouble. These banks began holding on
to their money, and lending dried up, and the gears of the American financial system
began grinding to a halt.

With the situation becoming more precarious by the day, I faced a choice, to step in with
dramatic government action or to stand back and allow the irresponsible actions of some
to undermine the financial security of all.

I'm a strong believer in free enterprise, so my natural instinct is to oppose government
intervention. I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of
business. Under normal circumstances, I would have followed this course. But these are
not normal circumstances. The market is not functioning properly. There has been a
widespread loss of confidence, and major sectors of America's financial system are at risk
of shutting down.

The government's top economic experts warn that, without immediate action by
Congress, America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would
unfold.

More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop
even more, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your
home could plummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically.

And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get
credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose
their jobs.

Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you
need to buy acar or send your children to college. And, ultimately, our country could
experience a long and painful recession.

Fellow citizens, we must not let this happen. I appreciate the work of leaders from both
parties in both houses of Congress to address this problem and to make improvements to
the proposal my administration sent to them.

 22/01/2024, 17:17 President Bush’s Speech to the Nation on the Economic Crisis - The New York Times

There is a Spirit of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans and between
Congress and this administration. In that spirit, I've invited Senators McCain and Obama
to join congressional leaders of both parties at the White House tomorrow to help speed
our discussions toward a bipartisan bill.

I know that an economic rescue package will present a tough vote for many members of
Congress. It is difficult to pass a bill that commits so much of the taxpayers' hard-earned
money.

I also understand the frustration of responsible Americans who pay their mortgages on
time, file their tax returns every April 15th, and are reluctant to pay the cost of excesses
on Wall Street.

But given the situation we are facing, not passing a bill now would cost these Americans
much more later.

Many Americans are asking, how would a rescue plan work? After much discussion,
there's now widespread agreement on the principles such a plan would include.

It would remove the risk posed by the troubled assets, including mortgage-backed
securities, now clogging the financial system. This would free banks to resume the flow of
credit to American families and businesses.

Any rescue plan should also be designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected. It should
welcome the participation of financial institutions, large and small. It should make certain
that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars.

BUSH: It should establish a bipartisan board to oversee the plan's implementation, and it
should be enacted as soon as possible.

In close consultation with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke, and SEC Chairman Chris Cox, I announced a plan on Friday.

First, the plan is big enough to solve a serious problem. Under our proposal, the federal
government would put up to $700 billion taxpayer dollars on the line to purchase troubled
assets that are clogging the financial system.

In the short term, this will free up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families
and businesses, and this will help our economy grow.

Second, as markets have lost confidence in mortgage-backed securities, their prices have
dropped sharply, yet the value of many of these assets will likely be higher than their
current price, because the vast majority of Americans will ultimately pay off their
mortgages.

The government is the one institution with the patience and resources to buy these assets
at their current low prices and hold them until markets return to normal.

 22/01/2024, 17:17 President Bush’s Speech to the Nation on the Economic Crisis - The New York Times

And when that happens, money will flow back to the Treasury as these assets are sold,
and we expect that much, if not all, of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back.

The final question is, what does this mean for your economic future? Well, the primary
steps -- purpose of the steps I've outlined tonight is to safeguard the financial security of
American workers, and families, and small businesses. The federal government also
continues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money.

The Treasury Department recently offered government insurance for money market
mutual funds. And through the FDIC, every savings account, checking account, and
certificate of deposit is insured by the federal government for up to $100,000.

The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years, and no one has ever lost a penny on an
insured deposit, and this will not change.

Once this crisis is resolved, there will be time to update our financial regulatory
structures. Our 21st-century global economy remains regulated largely by outdated 20th-
century laws.

Recently, we've seen how one company can grow so large that its failure jeopardizes the
entire financial system.

Earlier this year, Secretary Paulson proposed a blueprint that would modernize our
financial regulations. For example, the Federal Reserve would be authorized to take a
closer look at the operations of companies across the financial spectrum and ensure that
their practices do not threaten overall financial stability.

There are other good ideas, and members of Congress should consider them. As they do,
they must ensure that efforts to regulate Wall Street do not end up hampering our
economy's ability to grow.

In the long run, Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength.
Despite corrections in the marketplace and instances of abuse, democratic capitalism is
the best system ever devised.

It has unleashed the talents and the productivity and entrepreneurial spirit of our
citizens. It has made this country the best place in the world to invest and do business.
And it gives our economy the flexibility and resilience to absorb shocks, adjust, and
bounce back.

Our economy is facing a moment of great challenge, but we've overcome tough
challenges before, and we will overcome this one.

I know that Americans sometimes get discouraged by the tone in Washington and the
seemingly endless partisan struggles, yet history has shown that, in times of real trial,
elected officials rise to the occasion.

And together we will show the world once again what kind of country America Is: a

nation that tackles problems head on, where leaders come together to meet great tests,
and where people of every background can work hard, develop their talents, and realize
their dreams.

Thank you for listening. May God bless you.

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release January 27, 2010
Remarks by the President in State of the
Union Address
 THE PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress,
distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:
Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress
information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this
duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they've done so in
the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.
It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable
-- that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at
Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt.
When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on
Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the
courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions
and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to
move forward as one nation, as one people.
Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.
One year ago, | took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a
financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from
across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second
depression. So we acted -- immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of
the storm has passed.
But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many
businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural

 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty,
life has become that much harder.

This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been
dealing with for decades -- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being
unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.

So | know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are
the reason | ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places
like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. | hear about them in the letters that | read each
night. The toughest to read are those written by children -- asking why they have to move
from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.

For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are
frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall
Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been
unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the
shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.

So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -- what they
deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to
overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have
different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the
same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get
ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.

You know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity.
After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and
teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League
and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, ""We are strained but
hopeful, struggling but encouraged.""

It's because of this spirit -- this great decency and great strength -- that | have never been
more hopeful about America's future than | am tonight. (Applause.) Despite our
hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear
or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a
government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. (Applause.)

And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.

It begins with our economy.

Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped
cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified
Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank
bailout. | hated it -- Capplause.) | hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root
canal. (Laughter.

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 3/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
But when | ran for President, | promised | wouldn't just do what was popular -- | would do
what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system,
unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have
closed. More homes would have surely been lost.
So | supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program.
And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more
accountable. And as aresult, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of
the money we spent on the banks. (Applause.) Most but not all.
To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. (Applause.) Now, | know
Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses
again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their
time of need. (Applause.)
Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing
again, Save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed.
That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million
Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage
through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.
Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.
(Applause.) We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers.
We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million
Americans paying for college. (Applause.)
| thought I'd get some applause on that one. (Laughter and applause.)
As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other
necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised
income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not asingle dime. (Applause.)
Because of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now
who would otherwise be unemployed. (Applause.) Two hundred thousand work in
construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens
of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders. (Applause.)
And we're on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the
year.
The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery
Act. (Applause.) That's right -- the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill.
(Applause.) Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and
avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in
Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window
manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act,
https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 4/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to
the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school
that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.
There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the
economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their
value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire
again.
But | realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who
wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who
send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must
be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.
(Applause.)
Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses.
(Applause.) But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to
expand and hire more workers.
We should start where most new jobs do -- in small businesses, companies that begin
when -- (applause) -- companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an
entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became her
own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the
recession and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small businessowners in places
like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall
Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains
difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.
So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have
repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to
stay afloat. (Applause.) I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit
-- one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise
wages. (Applause.) While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small
business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small
businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. (Applause.)
Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.
(Applause.) From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has
always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest
trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.
Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-
speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. (Applause.) There are projects like that all
across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and
information. (Applause.)

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 5/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities -- (applause) --
and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which
supports clean energy jobs. (Applause.) And to encourage these and other businesses to
stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship
our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in
the United States of America. (Applause.)
Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. (Applause.) As
the first order of business this year, | urge the Senate to do the same, and | know they will.
(Applause.) They will. (Applause.) People are out of work. They're hurting. They need
our help. And | want a jobs bill on my desk without delay. (Applause.)
But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the seven million jobs that we've lost over
the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for
long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America's families
have confronted for years.
We can't afford another so-called economic ""expansion"" like the one from the last decade
-- what some call the ""lost decade"" -- where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior
expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost
of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing
bubble and financial speculation.
From the day | took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too
ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political
system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while.
For those who make these claims, | have one simple question: How long should we wait?
How long should America put its future on hold? (Applause.)
You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have
grown worse. Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany is not
waiting. India is not waiting. These nations -- they're not standing still. These nations
aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science.
They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean
energy because they want those jobs. Well, | do not accept second place for the United
States of America. (Applause.)
As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's
time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.
Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, | am not interested in punishing
banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market
makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the
savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we
guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.

 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they
need to make financial decisions. (Applause.) We can't allow financial institutions,
including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.
Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes.
(Applause.) And the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight.
(Applause.) And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform,
| will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right. (Applause.)
Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest
investment in basic research funding in history -- (applause) -- an investment that could
lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves
healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You
can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy -- in the North Carolina
company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in
the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.
But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency,
more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power
plants in this country. (Applause.) It means making tough decisions about opening new
offshore areas for oil and gas development. (Applause.) It means continued investment
in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. (Applause.) And, yes, it means passing
a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy
the profitable kind of energy in America. (Applause.)
| am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. (Applause.) And this year I'm
eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. (Applause.)
| know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough
economy. | know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific
evidence on climate change. But here's the thing -- even if you doubt the evidence,
providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our
future -- because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that
leads the global economy. And America must be that nation. (Applause.)
Third, we need to export more of our goods. (Applause.) Because the more products we
make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America.
(Applause.) So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five
years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. (Applause.) To help meet
this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small
businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national
security. (Applause.)
We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on
the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on
our shores. (Applause.) But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 7/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. (Applause.) And that's why we'll
continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will
strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama
and Colombia. (Applause.)

Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. (Applause.)

Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a
national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of
rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only
invest in reform -- reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in
math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young
Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best anti-
poverty program around is a world-class education. (Applause.) And in this country, the
success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.
When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with
Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. Still, in this economy, a high school
diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why | urge the Senate to follow the
House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career
pathway to the children of so many working families. (Applause.)

To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer
subsidies that go to banks for student loans. (Applause.) Instead, let's take that money
and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants.
(Applause.) And let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will
be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt
will be forgiven after 20 years -- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in
public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because
they chose to go to college. (Applause.)

And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their
own costs -- (applause) -- because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this
problem.

Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's
why last year | asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.
That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for
retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax
credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a
family's single largest investment -- their home. The steps we took last year to shore up
the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an
average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.

This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable
mortgages. (Applause.) And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 8/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
that we still need health insurance reform. (Applause.) Yes, we do. (Applause.)
Now, let's clear a few things up. (Laughter.) | didn't choose to tackle this issue to get
some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that | didn't
take on health care because it was good politics. (Laughter.) | took on health care
because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives
depend on getting coverage; patients who've been denied coverage; families -- even those
with insurance -- who are just one illness away from financial ruin.
After nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations
-- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans.
The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the
insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to
choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every
insurance plan to cover preventive care.
And by the way, | want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is
creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids
healthier. (Applause.) Thank you. She gets embarrassed. (Laughter.)
Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their
doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and
businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office -- the independent
organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress -- our
approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two
decades. (Applause.)
Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people
became. | take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American
people. And | know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most
Americans wondering, ""What's in it for me?""
But | also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight,
more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our
deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small
business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. | will not walk away from
these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber. (Applause.)
So, as temperatures cool, | want everyone to take another look at the plan we've
proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know
our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if
anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring
down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance
company abuses, let me know. (Applause.) Let me know. Let me know. (Applause.) I'm
eager to see It.

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 9/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
Here's what | ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when
we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American
people. (Applause.) Let's get it done. Let's get it done. (Applause.)

Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a
massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that
much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me
start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight.
At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over
$200 billion. (Applause.) By the time | took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1
trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the
result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug
program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget.
All this was before | walked in the door. (Laughter and applause.)
Now -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, | would have
liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a
crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to
our national debt. That, too, is a fact.
I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country
are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do
the same. (Applause.) So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion
dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.
Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years.
(Applause.) Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social
Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will. Like
any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and
sacrifice what we don't. And if | have to enforce this discipline by veto, | will.
(Applause.)
We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate
programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in
savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But
at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment
fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.
(Applause.)
Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit
we had when | took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social
Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal
commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent
Conrad. (Applause.) This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us
https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 10/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of
solutions by a certain deadline.

Now, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll
issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because | refuse to pass this
problem on to another generation of Americans. (Applause.) And when the vote comes
tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why
we had record surpluses in the 1990s. (Applause.)

Now, | know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or
freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And | agree -- which is why
this freeze won't take effect until next year -- (laughter) -- when the economy is stronger.
That's how budgeting works. (Laughter and applause.) But understand -- understand if
we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase
the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -- all of which would have an even
worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.

From some on the right, | expect we'll hear a different argument -- that if we just make
fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier
Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our
deficits will go away. The problem is that's what we did for eight years. (Applause.)
That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do
it again.

Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's
time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of
debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common
sense. (Laughter.) A novel concept.

To do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We
face a deficit of trust -- deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that
have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap we have to take action on both
ends of Pennsylvania Avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work
openly; to give our people the government they deserve. (Applause.)

That's what | came to Washington to do. That's why -- for the first time in history -- my
administration posts on our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded
lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.

But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make
on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits
on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.

With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a
century of law that | believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including
foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections. (Applause.) | don't think

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 11/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse,
by foreign entities. (Applause.) They should be decided by the American people. And I'd
urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these
problems.

I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. Applause.)
Democrats and Republicans. (Applause.) Democrats and Republicans. You've trimmed
some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change. But restoring the
public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark
requests online. (Applause.) Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark
requests on a single Web site before there's a vote, so that the American people can see
how their money is being spent. (Applause.)

Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work
with one another. Now, I'm not naive. | never thought that the mere fact of my election
would usher in peace and harmony -- (laughter) -- and some post-partisan era. | knew
that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues,
there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These
disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and
our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very
essence of our democracy.

But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election
Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the
most embarrassing headlines about the other side -- a belief that if you lose, | win.
Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The
confirmation of -- (applause) -- I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of
well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a
few individual senators. (Applause.)

Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no
matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has
stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further
division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.

So, no, | will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. | know it's an election
year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual.
But we still need to govern.

To Democrats, | would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and
the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills. (Applause.) And if the
Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any
business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- then the responsibility to govern is now
yours as well. (Applause.) Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics,

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 12/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.
(Applause.) So let's show the American people that we can do it together. (Applause.)
This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly
meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. | know you can't wait.
(Laughter.)
Throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly,
some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can argue all we want about who's
to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past. | know that all of us love
this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard
taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and
upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to
defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- for America and for the world.
(Applause.)
That's the work we began last year. Since the day | took office, we've renewed our focus
on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our
homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are
filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline
security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened
partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year,
hundreds of al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been
captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.
And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so
they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home.
(Applause.) We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the
rights of all Afghans -- men and women alike. (Applause.) We're joined by allies and
partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together
tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead.
But | am absolutely confident we will succeed.
As we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving lrag to its people. Asa
candidate, | promised that | would end this war, and that is what | am doing as President.
We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. (Applause.)
We will support the lragi government -- we will support the lragi government as they hold
elections, and we will continue to partner with the lragi people to promote regional peace
and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming
home. (Applause.)
Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in lrag, in Afghanistan, and around the
world -- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full
Support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a
responsibility to support them when they come home. (Applause.) That's why we made

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 13/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades -- last year. (Applause.)
That's why we're building a 21st century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill
Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families. (Applause.)
Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger
to the American people -- the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John
F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these
weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while
ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the
farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. (Applause.) And at April's
Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C.
behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four
years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists. (Applause.)
Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those
nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons.
That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions -- sanctions
that are being vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is more
united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to
ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing
consequences. That is a promise. (Applause.)
That's the leadership that we are providing -- engagement that advances the common
security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G20 to sustain a lasting
global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote
science and education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the
fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves, and
continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give
us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious
disease -- a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.
As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is
connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That's why,
as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help
the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. (Applause.) That's why we stand with the girl
who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the
women marching through the streets of Iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a
job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and
human dignity. (Applause.) Always. (Applause.)
Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is
true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined
in our Constitution: the notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or
What you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to
our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.

https://obamawhitehouse archives. gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address 14/16
 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division
that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination.
(Applause.) We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.
(Applause.) This year, | will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law
that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they
are. (Applause.) It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)
We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -- so that women get equal pay
for an equal day's work. (Applause.) And we should continue the work of fixing our
broken immigration system -- to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that
everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.
(Applause.)
In the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America -- values that allowed us to forge a
nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our
citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their
employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their
country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican
values or Democratic values that they're living by; business values or labor values. They're
American values.
Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our
corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these same values. Each
of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that
helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker
puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time
lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this
country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly
arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.
No wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much
disappointment.
| campaigned on the promise of change -- change we can believe in, the slogan went. And
right now, | know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can
change -- or that | can deliver it.
But remember this -- | never suggested that change would be easy, or that | could do it
alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and
complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions
and controversy. That's just how it is.
Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling
hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers
high, and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next
generation.

 22/01/2024, 16:17 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address | whitehouse.gov
But | also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or
200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because
generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even
when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for
their children and their grandchildren.
Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were
deserved. But | wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the
setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me
going -- what keeps me fighting -- is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of
determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core
of the American people, that lives on.
It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, “None
of us,"" he said, ""...are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.""
It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the
pain of recession, ""We are strong. We are resilient. We are American.""
It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if |
would give it to the people of Haiti.
And it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've
never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of
""U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!"" when another life was saved.
The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its
people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. Buta
new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. | don't quit.
(Applause.) Let's seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to
strengthen our union once more. (Applause.)
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. (Applause.) Myanmar Naingan, Mingalaba! (Laughter
and applause.) | am very honored to be here at this university and to be the first President
of the United States of America to visit your country.
| came here because of the importance of your country. You live at the crossroads of East
and South Asia. You border the most populated nations on the planet. You have a history
that reaches back thousands of years, and the ability to help determine the destiny of the
fastest growing region of the world.
| came here because of the beauty and diversity of your country. | have seen just earlier
today the golden stupa of Shwedagon, and have been moved by the timeless idea of metta
-- the belief that our time on this Earth can be defined by tolerance and by love. And |
know this land reaches from the crowded neighborhoods of this old city to the homes of
more than 60,000 villages; from the peaks of the Himalayas, the forests of Karen State, to
the banks of the Irrawady River.
| came here because of my respect for this university. It was here at this school where
opposition to colonial rule first took hold. It was here that Aung San edited a magazine
before leading an independence movement. It was here that U Thant learned the ways of
the world before guiding it at the United Nations. Here, scholarship thrived during the last
century and students demanded their basic human rights. Now, your Parliament has at
last passed a resolution to revitalize this university and it must reclaim its greatness,
because the future of this country will be determined by the education of its youth.
| came here because of the history between our two countries. A century ago, American
traders, merchants and missionaries came here to build bonds of faith and commerce and
friendship. And from within these borders in World War II, our pilots flew into China and
many of our troops gave their lives. Both of our nations emerged from the British Empire,
and the United States was among the first countries to recognize an independent Union of
Burma. We were proud to found an American Center in Rangoon and to build exchanges
with schools like this one. And through decades of differences, Americans have been
united in their affection for this country and its people.

Above all, | came here because of America’s belief in human dignity. Over the last several
decades, our two countries became strangers. But today, | can tell you that we always
remained hopeful about the people of this country, about you. You gave us hope and we
bore witness to your courage.

We saw the activists dressed in white visit the families of political prisoners on Sundays
and monks dressed in saffron protesting peacefully in the streets. We learned of ordinary
people who organized relief teams to respond to a cyclone, and heard the voices of
students and the beats of hip-hop artists projecting the sound of freedom. We came to
know exiles and refugees who never lost touch with their families or their ancestral home.
And we were inspired by the fierce dignity of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, as she proved that no
human being can truly be imprisoned if hope burns in your heart.

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
When | took office as President, | sent a message to those governments who ruled by fear.
| said, in my inauguration address, “We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench
your fist.” And over the last year and a half, a dramatic transition has begun, as a
dictatorship of five decades has loosened its grip. Under President Thein Sein, the desire
for change has been met by an agenda for reform. A civilian now leads the government,
and a parliament is asserting itself. The once-outlawed National League for Democracy
stood in an election, and Aung San Suu Kyi is a Member of Parliament. Hundreds of
prisoners of conscience have been released, and forced labor has been banned.
Preliminary cease-fires have been reached with ethnic armies, and new laws allow for a
more open economy.

So today, I've come to keep my promise and extend the hand of friendship. America now
has an Ambassador in Rangoon, sanctions have been eased, and we will help rebuild an
economy that can offer opportunity for its people, and serve as an engine of growth for the
world. But this remarkable journey has just begun, and has much further to go. Reforms
launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its
foundation. The flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished -- they
must be strengthened; they must become a shining North Star for all this nation’s people.
And your success in that effort is important to the United States, as well as to me. Even
though we come from different places, we share common dreams: to choose our leaders;
to live together in peace; to get an education and make a good living; to love our families
and our communities. That's why freedom is not an abstract idea; freedom is the very
thing that makes human progress possible -- not just at the ballot box, but in our daily
lives.

One of our greatest Presidents in the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, understood
this truth. He defined America’s cause as more than the right to cast a ballot. He
understood democracy was not just voting. He called upon the world to embrace four
fundamental freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and
freedom from fear. These four freedoms reinforce one another, and you cannot fully
realize one without realizing them all.

So that's the future that we seek for ourselves, and for all people. And that is what | want
to speak to you about today.

First, we believe in the right of free expression so that the voices of ordinary people can be
heard, and governments reflect their will -- the people's will.

In the United States, for more than two centuries, we have worked to keep this promise for
all of our citizens -- to win freedom for those who were enslaved; to extend the right to
vote for women and African Americans; to protect the rights of workers to organize.

And we recognize no two nations achieve these rights in exactly the same way, but there
is no question that your country will be stronger if it draws on the strength of all of its
people. That's what allows nations to succeed. That's what reform has begun to do.

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
Instead of being repressed, the right of people to assemble together must now be fully
respected. Instead of being stifled, the veil of media censorship must continue to be
lifted. And as you take these steps, you can draw on your progress. Instead of being
ignored, citizens who protested the construction of the Myitsone dam were heard.

Instead of being outlawed, political parties have been allowed to participate. You can see
progress being made. As one voter said during the parliamentary elections here, “Our
parents and grandparents waited for this, but never saw it.” And now you can see it. You
can taste freedom.

And to protect the freedom of all the voters, those in power must accept constraints.
That's what our American system is designed to do. Now, America may have the
strongest military in the world, but it must submit to civilian control. |, as the President of
the United States, make determinations that the military then carries out, not the other
way around. As President and Commander-In-Chief, | have that responsibility because I'm
accountable to the people.

Now, on other hand, as President, | cannot just impose my will on Congress -- the
Congress of the United States -- even though sometimes | wish | could. The legislative
branch has its own powers and its own prerogatives, and so they check my power and
balance my power. | appoint some of our judges, but | cannot tell them how to rule,
because every person in America -- from a child living in poverty to me, the President of
the United States -- is equal under the law. And a judge can make a determination as to
whether or not | am upholding the law or breaking the law. And 1am fully accountable to
that law.

And | describe our system in the United States because that's how you must reach for the
future that you deserve -- a future where a single prisoner of conscience is one too many.
You need to reach for a future where the law is stronger than any single leader, because
it's accountable to the people. You need to reach for a future where no child is made to be
a soldier and no woman is exploited, and where the laws protect them even if they're
vulnerable, even if they're weak; a future where national security is strengthened by a
military that serves under civilians and a Constitution that guarantees that only those who
are elected by the people may govern.

On that journey, America will support you every step of the way -- by using our assistance
to empower civil society; by engaging your military to promote professionalism and
human rights; and by partnering with you as you connect your progress towards
democracy with economic development. So advancing that journey will help you pursue a
second freedom -- the belief that all people should be free from want.

It's not enough to trade a prison of powerlessness for the pain of an empty stomach. But
history shows that governments of the people and by the people and for the people are far
more powerful in delivering prosperity. And that's the partnership we seek with you.

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
When ordinary people have a say in their own future, then your land can’t just be taken
away from you. And that's why reforms must ensure that the people of this nation can
have that most fundamental of possessions -- the right to own the title to the land on
which you live and on which you work.

When your talents are unleashed, then opportunity will be created for all people. America
is lifting our ban on companies doing business here, and your government has lifted
restrictions on investment and taken steps to open up your economy. And now, as more
wealth flows into your borders, we hope and expect that it will lift up more people. It can't
just help folks at the top. It has to help everybody. And that kind of economic growth,
where everybody has opportunity -- if you work hard, you can succeed -- that's what gets
a nation moving rapidly when it comes to develop.

But that kind of growth can only be created if corruption is left behind. For investment to
lead to opportunity, reform must promote budgets that are transparent and industry that
is privately owned.

To lead by example, America now insists that our companies meet high standards of
openness and transparency if they're doing business here. And we'll work with
organizations like the World Bank to support small businesses and to promote an
economy that allows entrepreneurs, small businesspeople to thrive and allows workers to
keep what they earn. And | very much welcome your government's recent decision to join
what we've called our Open Government Partnership, so that citizens can come to expect
accountability and learn exactly how monies are spent and how your system of
government operates.

Above all, when your voices are heard in government, it's far more likely that your basic
needs will be met. And that’s why reform must reach the daily lives of those who are
hungry and those who are ill, and those who live without electricity or water. And here,
too, America will do our part in working with you.

Today, | was proud to reestablish our USAID mission in this country, which is our lead
development agency. And the United States wants to be a partner in helping this country,
which used to be the rice bowl of Asia, to reestablish its capacity to feed its people and to
care for its sick, and educate its children, and build its democratic institutions as you
continue down the path of reform.

This country is famous for its natural resources, and they must be protected against
exploitation. And let us remember that in a global economy, a country’s greatest resource
is its people. So by investing in you, this nation can open the door for far more prosperity -
- because unlocking a nation’s potential depends on empowering all its people, especially
its young people.

Just as education is the key to America’s future, it is going to the be the key to your future
as well. And so we look forward to working with you, as we have with many of your
neighbors, to extend that opportunity and to deepen exchanges among our students. We

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
want students from this country to travel to the United States and learn from us, and we
want U.S. students to come here and learn from you.
And this truth leads me to the third freedom that | want to discuss: the freedom to
worship -- the freedom to worship as you please, and your right to basic human dignity.
This country, like my own country, is blessed with diversity. Not everybody looks the
same. Not everybody comes from the same region. Not everybody worships in the same
way. In your cities and towns, there are pagodas and temples, and mosques and churches
standing side by side. Well over a hundred ethnic groups have been a part of your story.
Yet within these borders, we've seen some of the world's longest running insurgencies,
which have cost countless lives, and torn families and communities apart, and stood in the
way of development.
No process of reform will succeed without national reconciliation. (Applause.) You now
have a moment of remarkable opportunity to transform cease-fires into lasting
settlements, and to pursue peace where conflicts still linger, including in Kachin State.
Those efforts must lead to a more just and lasting peace, including humanitarian access to
those in need, and a chance for the displaced to return home.
Today, we look at the recent violence in Rakhine State that has caused so much suffering,
and we see the danger of continued tensions there. For too long, the people of this state,
including ethnic Rakhine, have faced crushing poverty and persecution. But there is no
excuse for violence against innocent people. And the Rohingya hold themselves -- hold
within themselves the same dignity as you do, and | do.
National reconciliation will take time, but for the sake of our common humanity, and for
the sake of this country’s future, it is necessary to stop incitement and to stop violence.
And | welcome the government's commitment to address the issues of injustice and
accountability, and humanitarian access and citizenship. That's a vision that the world will
support as you move forward.
Every nation struggles to define citizenship. America has had great debates about these
issues, and those debates continue to this day, because we're a nation of immigrants --
people coming from every different part of the world. But what we've learned in the
United States is that there are certain principles that are universal, apply to everybody no
matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what religion you
practice. The right of people to live without the threat that their families may be harmed
or their homes may be burned simply because of who they are or where they come from.
Only the people of this country ultimately can define your union, can define what it means
to be acitizen of this country. But | have confidence that as you do that you can draw on
this diversity as a strength and not a weakness. Your country will be stronger because of
many different cultures, but you have to seize that opportunity. You have to recognize that
strength.

https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/19/remarks-president-obama-university-yangon 6/9
 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
| say this because my own country and my own life have taught me the power of diversity.
The United States of America is a nation of Christians and Jews, and Muslims and
Buddhists, and Hindus and non-believers. Our story is shaped by every language; it's
enriched by every culture. We have people from every corners of the world. We've tasted
the bitterness of civil war and segregation, but our history shows us that hatred in the
human heart can recede; that the lines between races and tribes fade away. And what's
left is a simple truth: e pluribus unum -- that’s what we say in America. Out of many, we
are one nation and we are one people. And that truth has, time and again, made our union
stronger. It has made our country stronger. It’s part of what has made America great.
We amended our Constitution to extend the democratic principles that we hold dear. And
| stand before you today as President of the most powerful nation on Earth, but
recognizing that once the color of my skin would have denied me the right to vote. And so
that should give you some sense that if our country can transcend its differences, then
yours can, too. Every human being within these borders is a part of your nation’s story,
and you should embrace that. That's not a source of weakness, that’s a source of strength
-- if you recognize it.
And that brings me to the final freedom that | will discuss today, and that is the right of all
people to live free from fear.
In many ways, fear is the force that stands between human beings and their dreams. Fear
of conflict and the weapons of war. Fear of a future that is different from the past. Fear of
changes that are reordering our societies and economy. Fear of people who look different,
or come from a different place, or worship in a different way. In some of her darkest
moments, when Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned, she wrote an essay about freedom
from fear. She said fear of losing corrupts those who wield it -- “Fear of losing power
corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are
subject to it.”
That's the fear that you can leave behind. We see that chance in leaders who are
beginning to understand that power comes from appealing to people's hopes, not people's
fears. We see it in citizens who insist that this time must be different, that this time
change will come and will continue. As Aung San Suu Kyi wrote: “Fear is not the natural
state of civilized man.” | believe that. And today, you are showing the world that fear does
not have to be the natural state of life in this country.
That's why | am here. That's why | came to Rangoon. And that’s why what happens here
is SO important -- not only to this region, but to the world. Because you're taking a journey
that has the potential to inspire so many people. This is a test of whether a country can
transition to a better place.
The United States of America is a Pacific nation, and we see our future as bound to those
nations and peoples to our West. And as our economy recovers, this is where we believe
we will find enormous growth. As we have ended the wars that have dominated our

https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/19/remarks-president-obama-university-yangon 7/9
 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
foreign policy for a decade, this region will be a focus for our efforts to build a prosperous
peace.

Here in Southeast Asia, we see the potential for integration among nations and people.
And as President, | have embraced ASEAN for reasons that go beyond the fact that | spent
some of my childhood in this region, in Indonesia. Because with ASEAN, we see nations
that are on the move -- nations that are growing, and democracies that are emerging;
governments that are cooperating; progress that’s building on the diversity that spans
oceans and islands and jungles and cities, peoples of every race and every religion. This is
what the 21st century should look like if we have the courage to put aside our differences
and move forward with a sense of mutual interest and mutual respect.

And here in Rangoon, | want to send a message across Asia: We don’t need to be defined
by the prisons of the past. We need to look forward to the future. To the leadership of
North Korea, | have offered a choice: let go of your nuclear weapons and choose the path
of peace and progress. If you do, you will find an extended hand from the United States of
America.

In 2012, we don’t need to cling to the divisions of East, West and North and South. We
welcome the peaceful rise of China, your neighbor to the North; and India, your neighbor
to the West. The United Nations -- the United States will work with any nation, large or
small, that will contribute to a world that is more peaceful and more prosperous, and more
just and more free. And the United States will be a friend to any nation that respects the
rights of its citizens and the responsibilities of international law.

That's the nation, that's the world that you can start to build here in this historic city. This
nation that's been so isolated can show the world the power of a new beginning, and
demonstrate once again that the journey to democracy goes hand in hand with
development. | say this knowing that there are still countless people in this country who
do not enjoy the opportunities that many of you seated here do. There are tens of millions
who have no electricity. There are prisoners of conscience who still await release. There
are refugees and displaced peoples in camps where hope is still something that lies on the
distant horizon.

Today, | say to you -- and | say to everybody that can hear my voice -- that the United
States of America is with you, including those who have been forgotten, those who are
dispossessed, those who are ostracized, those who are poor. We carry your story in our
heads and your hopes in our hearts, because in this 21st century with the spread of
technology and the breaking down of barriers, the frontlines of freedom are within nations
and individuals, not simply between them.

As one former prisoner put it in speaking to his fellow citizens, “Politics is your job. It's not
only for [the] politicians.” And we have an expression in the United States that the most
important office in a democracy is the office of citizen -- not President, not Speaker, but
citizen. (Applause.)

 22/01/2024, 16:20 Remarks by President Obama at the University of Yangon | whitehouse.gov
So as extraordinary and difficult and challenging and sometimes frustrating as this journey
may seem, in the end, you, the citizens of this country, are the ones who must define what
freedom means. You're the ones who are going to have to seize freedom, because a true
revolution of the spirit begins in each of our hearts. It requires the kind of courage that so
many of your leaders have already displayed.
The road ahead will be marked by huge challenges, and there will be those who resist the
forces of change. But | stand here with confidence that something is happening in this
country that cannot be reversed, and the will of the people can lift up this nation and set a
great example for the world. And you will have in the United States of America a partner
on that long journey. So, cezu tin bad de. (Applause.)
Thank you. (Applause.)

PRESIDENT OBAMA: (In progress) -- have shown us last night’s events were spectacular,
and this is a extraordinary setting for our meeting. And | very much appreciate the work
that you've done to develop a very productive agenda during this year’s APEC meeting.
I'd like to say to all my colleagues who are assembled here -- it’s good to be back with you SHARE
at APEC. This forum has been able to provide an extraordinarily important forum for ms
generating ideas that boost regional and then global integration, and has helped to provide v)
jobs and support growth in all of our economies.
Our meeting comes at a very important time for the global trading system. Just one year f)
ago we celebrated the conclusion of a historic trade facilitation agreement in Bali. As was (=)
just mentioned, that agreement has been breaking down over certain issues, although I'm
actually confident that there’s an opportunity for us to resolve them fairly soon. But it
does underscore how challenging it is to maintain and continue to grow our multilateral
trading system.
So we're going to need to focus on restoring and rebuilding the WTO's negotiating
function. A strong multilateral trading system that holds us together and a common
framework of rules has always been a bedrock of a healthy, global economy.
Meanwhile, APEC continues to play a central role in promoting economic integration
through regional and bilateral trade agreements. If these agreements are ambitious, they
can be stepping stones to greater integration rather than stumbling blocks.
APEC has been the incubator of ambitious trade agreements at the center of our agenda.
This is where the trade facilitation agreement started. It was APEC’s work that led to the
Information Technology Agreement -- the ITA -- which we are now negotiating to expand.
So it's fitting that we're here with our APEC colleagues to share the news that the United
States and China have reached an understanding on the ITA that we hope will contribute
to a rapid conclusion of the broader negotiations in Geneva. We think that’s good news.
And | very much thank President Xi's efforts in that regard.
APEC is often at its best and most effective on the more technologic -- the more technical
cooperation to boost the flow of goods and services across our borders. This is the small
details day to day that remove bottlenecks to trade and reduce the cost of transactions.
In February, | signed an executive order establishing a single window, for example, to
speed the processing of cargo flows in and out of the United States. We welcome APEC's
commitment to help all our economies streamline procedures and build capacity so we
can meet our goals of reducing the time and the costs of border crossings by 10 percent by
next year.
| want to welcome APEC’s endorsement of ideas we discussed in Honolulu to create more
transparent procedures for citizens and businesses to comment on proposed new
regulations, which | think represents an important step forward for businesses that want
to cooperate seamlessly across borders and jurisdictions.

These efforts are not always large and public; they don't always get a lot of attention. But
they represent the important strides in bringing our people closer together and making our
economies stronger.
, , , , SHARE
And finally, | want to commend China for focusing this year on what APEC can do to THIS:
contribute to the realization of the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific. The goal of FTAAP |
was announced in 2006 and, as leaders noted, the many regional initiatives will contribute v)
to the eventual realization. We see our engagement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a
contribution towards that effort. | look forward to the day when all of our economies can fF)
be linked together in a high-standard, 21st century agreement. And | think that the work
and the efforts of President Xi in setting this agenda here today will help facilitate that. So (=)
we thank you very much, Mr. President, for your extraordinary hospitality.

 22/01/2024, 16:43 Remarks by the President on the Paris Agreement | whitehouse.gov
3:30 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody. Today is a historic day in the fight to
protect our planet for future generations.
Ten months ago, in Paris, | said before the world that we needed a strong global agreement
to reduce carbon pollution and to set the world on a low-carbon course. The result was
the Paris Agreement. Last month, the United States and China -- the world's two largest
economies and largest emitters -- formally joined that agreement together. And today,
the world has officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect.
Today, the world meets the moment. And if we follow through on the commitments that
this agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.
Of course, it took a long time to reach this day. One of the reasons | ran for this office was
to make America a leader in this mission. And over the past eight years, we've done just
that. In 2009, we salvaged a chaotic climate summit in Copenhagen, establishing the
principle that all nations have a role to play in combating climate change. And at home,
we led by example, with historic investments in growing industries like wind and solar that
created a steady stream of new jobs. We set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit
the amount of carbon pollution that power plants can dump into the air our children
breathe. From the cars and trucks we drive to the homes and businesses in which we live
and work, we've changed fundamentally the way we consume energy.
Now, keep in mind, the skeptics said these actions would kill jobs. And instead, we saw --
even as we were bringing down these carbon levels -- the longest streak of job creation in
American history. We drove economic output to new highs. And we drove our carbon
pollution to its lowest levels in two decades.
We continued to lead by example with our historic joint announcement with China two
years ago, where we put forward even more ambitious climate targets. And that
achievement encouraged dozens of other countries to set more ambitious climate targets
of their own. And that, in turn, paved the way for our success in Paris -- the idea that no
nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone. All of us have to
solve it together.
Now, the Paris Agreement alone will not solve the climate crisis. Even if we meet every
target embodied in the agreement, we'll only get to part of where we need to go. But
make no mistake, this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences
of climate change. It will help other nations ratchet down their dangerous carbon
emissions over time, and set bolder targets as technology advances, all under a strong
system of transparency that allows each nation to evaluate the progress of all other
nations. And by sending a signal that this is going to be our future -- a clean energy future
-- it opens up the floodgates for businesses, and scientists, and engineers to unleash high-
tech, low-carbon investment and innovation at a scale that we've never seen before. So
this gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we've got.

 22/01/2024, 16:43 Remarks by the President on the Paris Agreement | whitehouse.gov
| know diplomacy “can be [isn't always] easy, and progress on the world stage can
sometimes be slow. But together, with steady persistent effort, with strong, principled,
American leadership, with optimism and faith and hope, we're proving that it is possible.
And | want to embarrass my Senior Advisor, Brian Deese -- who is standing right over
there -- because he worked tirelessly to make this deal possible. He, and John Kerry, Gina
McCarthy at the EPA, everybody on their teams have done an extraordinary job to get us
to this point -- and America should be as proud of them as | am of them.
| also want to thank the people of every nation that has moved quickly to bring the Paris
Agreement into force. | encourage folks who have not yet submitted their documentation
to enter into this agreement to do so as soon as possible. And in the coming days, let’s
help finish additional agreements to limit aviation emissions, to phase down dangerous
use of hydrofluorocarbons -- all of which will help build a world that is safer, and more
prosperous, and more secure, and more free than the one that was left for us.
That's our most important mission, to make sure our kids and our grandkids have at least
as beautiful a planet, and hopefully more beautiful, than the one that we have. And today,
I'ma little more confident that we can get the job done.
So thank you very much, everybody.

Remarks by President Trump to the
73rd Session of the United Nations
General Assembly | New York, NY
—— FOREIGN POLICY Issued on: September 25, 2018

United Nations Headquarters

New York, New York

10:38 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, world leaders,

ambassadors, and distinguished delegates:

One year ago, | stood before you for the first time in this grand hall. | addressed the

threats facing our world, and | presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of

humanity.

Today, | stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the extraordinary

progress we’ve made.

In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any

administration in the history of our country.

America’s — so true. (Laughter.) Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s okay. (Laughter

and applause.)

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
America’s economy is booming like never before. Since my election, we’ve added $10
trillion in wealth. The stock market is at an all-time high in history, and jobless claims
are at a 50-year low. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American
unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. We’ve added
more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs.

We have passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We’ve started

the construction of a major border wall, and we have greatly strengthened border

security.

We have secured record funding for our military — $700 billion this year, and $716

billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been

before.

In other words, the United States is stronger, safer, and a richer country than it was

when | assumed office less than two years ago.

We are standing up for America and for the American people. And we are also

standing up for the world.

This is great news for our citizens and for peace-loving people everywhere. We

believe that when nations respect the rights of their neighbors, and defend the

interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of

safety, prosperity, and peace.

Each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history, and a people

bound together by ties of memory, tradition, and the values that make our

homelands like nowhere else on Earth.

That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global

governance, control, and domination.

| honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and

traditions. The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship.

We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
From Warsaw to Brussels, to Tokyo to Singapore, it has been my highest honor to
represent the United States abroad. | have forged close relationships and friendships
and strong partnerships with the leaders of many nations in this room, and our
approach has already yielded incredible change.

With support from many countries here today, we have engaged with North Korea to
replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace.

In June, | traveled to Singapore to meet face to face with North Korea’s leader,
Chairman Kim Jong Un.

We had highly productive conversations and meetings, and we agreed that it was in
both countries’ interest to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Since
that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few
could have imagined only a short time ago.

The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction. Nuclear testing has
stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have
been released. And as promised, the remains of our fallen heroes are being returned
home to lay at rest in American soil.

| would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken,
though much work remains to be done. The sanctions will stay in place until
denuclearization occurs.

| also want to thank the many member states who helped us reach this moment — a
moment that is actually far greater than people would understand; far greater — but
for also their support and the critical support that we will all need going forward.

A special thanks to President Moon of South Korea, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and
President Xi of China.

In the Middle East, our new approach is also yielding great strides and very historic
change.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
Following my trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Gulf countries opened a new center to
target terrorist financing. They are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to
identify and track terrorist networks, and taking more responsibility for fighting
terrorism and extremism in their own region.

The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of
Syria and Yemen. And they are pursuing multiple avenues to ending Yemen’s horrible,
horrific civil war.

Ultimately, it is up to the nations of the region to decide what kind of future they want
for themselves and their children.

For that reason, the United States is working with the Gulf Cooperation Council,
Jordan, and Egypt to establish a regional strategic alliance so that Middle Eastern
nations can advance prosperity, stability, and security across their home region.
Thanks to the United States military and our partnership with many of your nations, |
am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS have been driven out
from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria. We will continue to work with
friends and allies to deny radical Islamic terrorists any funding, territory or support,
or any means of infiltrating our borders.

The ongoing tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking. Our shared goals must be the de-
escalation of military conflict, along with a political solution that honors the will of
the Syrian people. In this vein, we urge the United Nations-led peace process be
reinvigorated. But, rest assured, the United States will respond if chemical weapons
are deployed by the Assad regime.

| commend the people of Jordan and other neighboring countries for hosting
refugees from this very brutal civil war.

As we see in Jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to
their homes as possible to ease their eventual return to be part of the rebuilding
process. This approach also stretches finite resources to help far more people,
increasing the impact of every dollar spent.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
Every solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria must also include a strategy to
address the brutal regime that has fueled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship in
lran.
lran’s leaders sow chaos, death, and destruction. They do not respect their neighbors
or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran’s leaders plunder the
nation’s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle
East and far beyond.

The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of
dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy, and looted the
people’s religious endowments, all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to
wage war. Not good.

lran’s neighbors have paid a heavy toll for the region’s [regime’s] agenda of
aggression and expansion. That is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly
supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran
Nuclear Deal and re-impose nuclear sanctions.

The Iran deal was a windfall for Iran’s leaders. In the years since the deal was reached,
lran’s military budget grew nearly 40 percent. The dictatorship used the funds to
build nuclear-capable missiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism, and
fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen.

The United States has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime
the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda. Last month, we began re-imposing
hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that had been lifted under the Iran deal. Additional
sanctions will resume November 5th, and more will follow. And we’re working with
countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially.

We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s
most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a regime that chants “Death to America,”
and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear
warhead to any city on Earth. Just can’t do it.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
We ask all nations to isolate Iran’s regime as long as its aggression continues. And we
ask all nations to support Iran’s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and
righteous destiny.

This year, we also took another significant step forward in the Middle East. In
recognition of every sovereign state to determine its own capital, | moved the U.S.
Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

The United States is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region,
including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That aim is advanced, not
harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts.

America’s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old
dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong
over the years, time and time again. This is true not only in matters of peace, but in
matters of prosperity.

We believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal. The United States will not be taken
advantage of any longer.

For decades, the United States opened its economy — the largest, by far, on Earth —
with few conditions. We allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely
across our borders.

Yet, other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets in
return. Even worse, some countries abused their openness to dump their products,
subsidize their goods, target our industries, and manipulate their currencies to gain
unfair advantage over our country. As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly
$800 billion a year.

For this reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals.
Last month, we announced a groundbreaking U.S.-Mexico trade agreement. And just
yesterday, | stood with President Moon to announce the successful completion of the
brand new U.S.-Korea trade deal. And this is just the beginning.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
Many nations in this hall will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of
change. For example, countries were admitted to the World Trade Organization that
violate every single principle on which the organization is based. While the United
States and many other nations play by the rules, these countries use government-run
industrial planning and state-owned enterprises to rig the system in their favor. They
engage in relentless product dumping, forced technology transfer, and the theft of
intellectual property.

The United States lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel
jobs, and 60,000 factories after China joined the WTO. And we have racked up $13
trillion in trade deficits over the last two decades.

But those days are over. We will no longer tolerate such abuse. We will not allow our
workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be
plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens.
The United States has just announced tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese-made
goods for a total, so far, of $250 billion. | have great respect and affection for my
friend, President Xi, but | have made clear our trade imbalance is just not acceptable.
China’s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated.

As my administration has demonstrated, America will always act in our national
interest.

| spoke before this body last year and warned that the U.N. Human Rights Council had
become a grave embarrassment to this institution, shielding egregious human rights
abusers while bashing America and its many friends.

Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, laid out a clear agenda for
reform, but despite reported and repeated warnings, no action at all was taken.

So the United States took the only responsible course: We withdrew from the Human
Rights Council, and we will not return until real reform is enacted.

For similar reasons, the United States will provide no support in recognition to the
International Criminal Court. As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no
jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority. The ICC claims near-universal

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice,
fairness, and due process. We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an
unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy.

America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we
embrace the doctrine of patriotism.

Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not
just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and
domination.

In America, we believe strongly in energy security for ourselves and for our allies. We
have become the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the Earth.

The United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean
coal, and natural gas.

OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and! don’t
like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then
they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good.

We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices, and they
must contribute substantially to military protection from now on. We are not going to
put up with it — these horrible prices — much longer.

Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and
intimidation. That is why we congratulate European states, such as Poland, for
leading the construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on
Russia to meet their energy needs. Germany will become totally dependent on
Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.

Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence
from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe that we reject the
interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs. The United
States has recently strengthened our laws to better screen foreign investments in our
country for national security threats, and we welcome cooperation with countries in
this region and around the world that wish to do the same. You need to do it for your
own protection.

The United States is also working with partners in Latin America to confront threats to
sovereignty from uncontrolled migration. Tolerance for human struggling and human
smuggling and trafficking is not humane. It’s a horrible thing that’s going on, at levels
that nobody has ever seen before. It’s very, very cruel.

Illegal immigration funds criminal networks, ruthless gangs, and the flow of deadly
drugs. Illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, hurts hardworking
citizens, and has produced a vicious cycle of crime, violence, and poverty. Only by
upholding national borders, destroying criminal gangs, can we break this cycle and
establish a real foundation for prosperity.

We recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy
in accordance with its national interests, just as we ask other countries to respect our
own right to do the same — which we are doing. That is one reason the United States
will not participate in the new Global Compact on Migration. Migration should not be
governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens.

Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build
more hopeful futures in their home countries. Make their countries great again.
Currently, we are witnessing a human tragedy, as an example, in Venezuela. More
than 2 million people have fled the anguish inflicted by the socialist Maduro regime
and its Cuban sponsors.

Not long ago, Venezuela was one of the richest countries on Earth. Today, socialism
has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
Virtually everywhere socialism or communism has been tried, it has produced
suffering, corruption, and decay. Socialism’s thirst for power leads to expansion,
incursion, and oppression. All nations of the world should resist socialism and the
misery that it brings to everyone.

In that spirit, we ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration
of democracy in Venezuela. Today, we are announcing additional sanctions against
the repressive regime, targeting Maduro’s inner circle and close advisors.

We are grateful for all the work the United Nations does around the world to help
people build better lives for themselves and their families.

The United States is the world’s largest giver in the world, by far, of foreign aid. But
few give anything to us. That is why we are taking a hard look at U.S. foreign
assistance. That will be headed up by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We will
examine what is working, what is not working, and whether the countries who receive
our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart.

Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and,
frankly, are our friends. And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the
cost of their defense.

The United States is committed to making the United Nations more effective and
accountable. | have said many times that the United Nations has unlimited potential.
As part of our reform effort, | have told our negotiators that the United States will not
pay more than 25 percent of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. This will encourage other
countries to step up, get involved, and also share in this very large burden.

And we are working to shift more of our funding from assessed contributions to
voluntary so that we can target American resources to the programs with the best
record of success.

Only when each of us does our part and contributes our share can we realize the
U.N.’s highest aspirations. We must pursue peace without fear, hope without despair,
and security without apology.

 22/01/2024, 16:46 Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly | New York, NY — The White House
Looking around this hall where so much history has transpired, we think of the many
before us who have come here to address the challenges of their nations and of their
times. And our thoughts turn to the same question that ran through all their speeches
and resolutions, through every word and every hope. It is the question of what kind
of world will we leave for our children and what kind of nations they will inherit.

The dreams that fill this hall today are as diverse as the people who have stood at this
podium, and as varied as the countries represented right here in this body are. It
really is something. It really is great, great history.

There is India, a free society over a billion people, successfully lifting countless
millions out of poverty and into the middle class.

There is Saudi Arabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are pursuing bold
new reforms.

There is Israel, proudly celebrating its 70th anniversary as a thriving democracy in the
Holy Land.

In Poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, their security, and
their sovereignty.

Many countries are pursuing their own unique visions, building their own hopeful
futures, and chasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, of legacy, and of ahome.
The whole world is richer, humanity is better, because of this beautiful constellation
of nations, each very special, each very unique, and each shining brightly in its part of
the world.

In each one, we see awesome promise of a people bound together by a shared past
and working toward a common future.

As for Americans, we know what kind of future we want for ourselves. We know what
kind of anation America must always be.

In America, we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual. We
believe in self-government and the rule of law. And we prize the culture that sustains
our liberty -- a culture built on strong families, deep faith, and fierce independence.
We celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions, and above all, we love our
country.

Inside everyone in this great chamber today, and everyone listening all around the
globe, there is the heart of a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your nation,
the same intense loyalty to your homeland.
The passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the souls of nations has inspired
reform and revolution, sacrifice and selflessness, scientific breakthroughs, and
magnificent works of art.
Our task is not to erase it, but to embrace it. To build with it. To draw on its ancient
wisdom. And to find within it the will to make our nations greater, our regions safer,
and the world better.
To unleash this incredible potential in our people, we must defend the foundations
that make it all possible. Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle
where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, or peace has ever
prospered. And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence
above all.
When we do, we will find new avenues for cooperation unfolding before us. We will
find new passion for peacemaking rising within us. We will find new purpose, new
resolve, and new spirit flourishing all around us, and making this a more beautiful
world in which to live.
So together, let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose
peace and freedom over domination and defeat. And let us come here to this place to
stand for our people and their nations, forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just,
and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of God.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the nations of the world.

Donald Trump, January 6 CIN}
The Ellipse
The media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when | turned on today, | looked, and |
saw thousands of people here, but you don’t see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because
they don’t want to show that. We have hundreds of thousands of people here, and | just want them to
be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras, please, and show what’s really happening
out here, because these people are not going to take it any longer. They’re not going to take it any
longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show?
They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country. | just really want
to see what they do. | just want to see how they covered. I’ve never seen anything like it. But it would be
really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have, as far
as I’m concerned, single biggest problem -- the fake news and the big tech. Big tech is now coming into
their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year,
they rigged an election. They rigged it like they’ve never rigged an election before. And by the way, last
night they didn’t do a bad job either, if you notice. I’m honest.
Just, again, | want to thank you. It’s just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you
and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and
the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen
by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they’re doing, and stolen by the fake news media.
That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It
doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.
Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that’s what this is all about. And to use a
favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will “stop the steal.” Today, | will lay out just
some of the evidence proving that we won this election, and we won it by a landslide. This was not a
close election.
You know, | say sometimes jokingly, but there’s no joke about it, I’ve been in two elections. | won them
both and the second one, | won much bigger than the first. OK? Almost 75 million people voted for our
campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more
people than four years ago. And | was told by the real pollsters, we do have real pollsters. They know
that we were going to do well, and we were going to win. What | was told, if | went from 63 million,
which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn’t go to 66. We
went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn’t lose.
And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had
80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You could take Third
World countries. Just take a look, take Third World countries. Their elections are more honest than what
we've been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. Even when you look at last
night, they’re all running around like chickens with their heads cut off, with boxes. Nobody knows what
the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices.
We’re not going to let it happen. Not going to let it happen.
 [Crowd noise]

Thank you. And I’d love to have, if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed, the military, the
Secret Service, and we want to thank you, and the police, law enforcement. Great. You’re doing a great
job. But I’d love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let
them come up, please? And Rudy [Giuliani], you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got
guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights. He fights, and I’Il tell you.
Thank you very much, John [Eastman]. Fantastic job. | watched.

That’s a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he
looked at this and he said, “What an absolute disgrace, that this could be happening to our
Constitution.” And he looked at Mike Pence, and | hope Mike is going to do the right thing.

| hope so. | hope so, because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do. All
-- this is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country. He has
the absolute right to do it. We’re supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our
Constitution and protect our Constitution. States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were
given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice
President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president, and you
are the happiest people.

And | actually, | just spoke to Mike. | said, “Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do
nothing. That takes courage,” and then we’re stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and
we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen. Many of you have
traveled from all across the nation to be here, and | want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That’s
what it is. There’s never been a movement like this ever, ever, for the extraordinary love for this
amazing country and this amazing movement. Thank you.

[Crowd noise]

By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. Do you believe this? Look at
this. Unfortunately, they gave the press the prime seats. | can’t stand that. No, but you look at that,
behind. | wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they
make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing, amazing, all the way back. And don’t worry, we
will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not. Cancel culture. You know, they
wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial, either take it down or just put somebody else in there. |
don’t think that’s going to happen. It damn well better not. Although with this administration, if this
happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen.

They'll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They’ve been taking his statue down. But then we signed a
little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything
stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped. And they could use Rudy back in New York City.
Rudy, they could use you. Your city is going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We’ll get
a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?

We’re gathered together in the heart of our nation’s capital for one very, very basic and simple reason:
to save our democracy. Most candidates on election evening -- of course this thing goes on so long, they
 still don’t have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have
no idea. They’ve totally lost control. They’ve used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people ina
proper election. But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what’s happening,
number one, they all say, “Sir, we’ll never let it happen again.” | said, “That’s good, but what about eight
weeks ago?” You know, they try and get you to go. They say, “Sir, in four years, you’re guaranteed.” |
said, “I’m not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. | want to go back eight weeks.
Let’s go back eight weeks.” We want to go back, and we want to get this right because we’re going to
have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed, and we’re not
going to stand for that.

For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans, and that’s what they
are. There’s so many weak Republicans. We have great ones, Jim Jordan, and some of these guys.
They’re out there fighting. The House guys are fighting, but it’s incredible. Many of the Republicans, |
helped them get in. | helped them get elected. | helped Mitch [McConnell] get elected. | helped -- | could
name 24 of them, let’s say. | won’t bore you with it, and then all of a sudden you have something like
this. It’s like, “Oh, gee, maybe I'll talk to the President sometime later.” No, it’s amazing. The weak
Republicans, they’re pathetic Republicans and that’s what happens. If this happened to the Democrats,
there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember
this. You’re stronger. You’re smarter. You've got more going than anybody, and they try and demean
everybody having to do with us, and you’re the real people. You’re the people that built this nation.
You’re not the people that tore down our nation.

The weak Republicans, and that’s it. | really believe it. | think I’m going to use the term, the weak
Republicans. You got a lot of them, and you got a lot of great ones, but you got a lot of weak ones.
They’ve turned a blind eye even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened
our military, threw open our borders and put America last. Did you see the other day where Joe Biden
said, “| want to get rid of the America First policy”? What’s that all about, get rid of -- how do you say, “|
want to get rid of America First”? Even if you’re going to do it, don’t talk about it, right? Unbelievable,
what we have to go through, what we have to go through, and you have to get your people to fight. And
if they don’t fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. You primary them. We’re
going to let you know who they are. | can already tell you, frankly.

But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted
the most brazen and outrageous election theft. There’s never been anything like this. It’s a pure theft in
American history. Everybody knows it. That election, our election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening.
We’re leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes, and then late in the
evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit, and all of a sudden. All of a sudden it
started to happen.

Don’t forget when [Mitt] Romney got beat. Romney. Did you see his -- | wonder if he enjoyed his flight in
last night? But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you’re more typical — “Well, I’d
like to congratulate the victor.” The victor? Who was the victor, Mitt? “I'd like to congratulate.” They
don’t go and look at the facts. Now, | don’t know. He got slaughtered probably, maybe it was OK. Maybe
it was -- that’s what happened. But we look at the facts, and our election was so corrupt that in the
history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back. You know, America
is blessed with elections. All over the world, they talk about our elections. You know what the world says
about us now? They say we don’t have free and fair elections. And you know what else? We don’t have
a free and fair press.
 Our media is not free. It’s not fair. It suppresses thought. It suppresses speech, and it’s become the
enemy of the people. It’s become the enemy of the people. It’s the biggest problem we have in this
country. No Third World countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing, and you'll
hear about that in just a few minutes. Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied
behind his back. It’s like a boxer, and we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody,
including bad people. And we’re going to have to fight much harder, and Mike Pence is going to have to
come through for us. And if he doesn’t, that will be a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to
uphold our Constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.
And after this, we’re going to walk down -- and I’Il be there with you -- we’re going to walk down. We’re
going to walk down any one you want, but | think right here. We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and
we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women. And we’re probably not
going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with
weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.

We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been
lawfully slated, lawfully slated. | know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol
building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today we will see whether Republicans
stand strong for integrity of our elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country, our
country. Our country has been under siege for a long time, far longer than this four-year period. We’ve
set it on a much straighter course, a much... | thought four more years. | thought it would be easy.

We created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in
history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There’s no president, whether it’s four years,
eight years, or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts. It used to take 20 years to geta
highway approved. Now we’re down to two. | want to get it down to one, but we’re down to two. And it
may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down the safety. We created Space
Force. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force, which by
and of itself is a major achievement for an administration. And with us, it’s one of so many different
things.

Right to try. Everybody knows about right to try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We
took care of our vets. Our vets, the VA now has the highest rating, 91%, the highest rating that it’s had
from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always you watch the VA, when it was on television. Every
night people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got
it so that now in the VA, you don’t have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to
see a doctor. If you can’t get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor, you have them taken care of.
And we pay the doctor. And we’ve not only made life wonderful for so many people, we’ve saved
tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we’ve saved a lot of money.

And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans
horribly. In prime time, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans
horribly. And we have what’s called the VA Accountability Act. And the Accountability says if we see
somebody in there that doesn’t treat our vets well, or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say,
“Joe, you're fired. Get out of here.” Before, you couldn’t do that. You couldn’t do that before.

So we’ve taken care of things. We’ve done things like nobody’s ever thought possible. And that’s part of
the reason that many people don’t like us, because we’ve done too much, but we’ve done it quickly.
 And we were going to sit home and watch a big victory. And everybody had us down for a victory. It was
going to be great. And now we’re out here fighting. | said to somebody, | was going to take a few days
and relax after our big electoral victory. Ten o’clock, it was over. But | was going to take a few days.

And | can say this, since our election, | believe, which was a catastrophe when | watch and even these
guys knew what happened, they know what happened. They’re saying, “Wow, Pennsylvania’s
insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin, look at the big leads we had.” Even though the press said we were
going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said Ohio is going to be close, we set a
record. Florida’s going to be close -- we set a record. Texas is going to be close. Texas is going to be close
-- we set a record. And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community. We set a record with
everybody.

Today, we see a very important event though, because right over there, right there, we see the event
going to take place. And I’m going to be watching, because history is going to be made. We’re going to
see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that
should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity, they'll be ashamed. And you
know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never ever forget that they did. Never forget. We
should never ever forget. With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the
United States.

And by the way, it’s much more important today than it was 24 hours ago. Because | spoke to David
Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup. And, you know, |
said, “We have no back line anymore.” The only back line, the only line of demarcation, the only line
that we have is the veto of the President of the United States. So this is now what we’re doing, a far
more important election than it was two days ago.

| want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They’re over there
working like you’ve never seen before, studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the
roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally got.
They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted, because what did they know? And then
when they found out a few weeks later -- again, it took them four years to devise history. And the only
unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton because she said, “Why
didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Why didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Change the
votes! 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing!” But she’s not too happy. You
notice you don’t see her anymore. What happened? Where is Hillary? Where is she?

But | want to thank all of those congressmen and women. | also want to thank our 13 most courageous
members of the US Senate, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Ron Johnson, Sen. Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler. And Kelly
Loeffler, I’ll tell you, she’s been so great. She works so hard. So let’s give her and David a little special --
because it was rigged against them. Let’s give her and David. Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue. They fought a
good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and |
was telling these people don’t let them use this stuff. Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun,
Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis. Tommy
Tuberville, the coach. And Roger Marshall. We want to thank them, senators that stepped up, we want
to thank them.

| actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up. And | think a lot of those people are
going to find that out, and you better start looking at your leadership because the leadership has led you
 down the tubes. You know? “We don’t want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600.” Oh,
great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics. But how
does it play politically? China destroyed these people. We didn’t destroy -- China destroyed them, totally
destroyed them. We want to give them $600, and they just wouldn’t change. | said, ""Give them $2,000.
We'll pay it back. We’ll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion. Give them a couple of bucks. Let
them live. Give them a couple of bucks!”

And some of the people here disagree with me on that. But | just say, look, you got to let people live.
And how does that play though? OK, number one, it’s the right thing to do. But how does that play
politically? | think it’s the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating.
That was the super primary reason. But you can’t do that. You got to use your head.

As you know the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of
widespread fraud. You ever see these people? “While there is no evidence of fraud” -- oh, really? Well,
I’m going to read you pages. | hope you don’t get bored listening to it. Promise? Don’t get bored
listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please. Yeah. All
these people, don’t get bored. Don’t get angry at me because you’re going to get bored because it’s so
much. The American people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore. They have ruined their
reputation.

But it used to be that they'd argue with me, I’d fight. So I’d fight, they’d fight. I’d fight, they’d fight.
Boop-boop. You’d believe me, you’d believe them. Somebody comes out. You know. They had their
point of view, | had my point of view. But you’d have an argument. Now what they do is they go silent.
It’s called suppression. And that’s what happens in a communist country. That’s what they do. They
suppress. You don’t fight with them anymore, unless it’s a bad story. If they have a little bad story about
me, they'll make it 10 times worse and it’s a major headline. But Hunter Biden, they don’t talk about
him. What happened to Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? They don’t talk about him.

Now watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can’t do that because they get good ratings. The ratings
are too good. Now where is Hunter? And how come Joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to
get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I’d ask you that question. How does that
happen? Can you imagine if | said that? If | said that it would be a whole different ball game. And how
come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, and gets hundreds
of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy,
and millions of dollars up front, and how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars
to manage? “Have you managed money before?” “No, | haven’t.” “Oh, that’s good. Here’s about $3
billion.”

No, they don’t talk about that. No, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They’ve gone dead. |
now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years. | realize how good, even though | didn’t necessarily
love him, | realized how good, it was like a cleansing motion. Right? But we don’t have that anymore.
We don’t have a fair media anymore. It’s suppression, and you have to be very careful with that. And
they’ve lost all credibility in this country. We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the
lies that we’ve been forced to believe over the past several weeks. We’ve amassed overwhelming
evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because
of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.

You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And, you know, when | endorsed him, |
 didn’t know this guy. At the request of David Perdue. He said, “A friend of mine is running for governor.”
“What's his name?” And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. | don’t know. He was way
-- He was doing poorly. | endorsed him. He went like a rocket ship and he won. And then | had to beat
Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. | had to beat Stacey Abrams and | had to beat Oprah, used to
be a friend of mine. | was on her last show. Her last week she picked the five outstanding people. | don’t
think she thinks that anymore. Once | ran for president, | didn’t notice there were too many calls coming
in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me, but | was one of the five outstanding people.

And | had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama against Stacey. And | had
Brian Kemp, he weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I’m trying to figure that.
I’m still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, “Il was an offensive lineman.” I’m saying,
“Really? That must’ve been a very small team.” But | look at that and | look at what’s happened, and he
turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.

You know, look, I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. | picked three
people. | fought like hell for them, one in particular | fought. They all said, “Sir, cut him loose. He’s killing
us.” The senators, you know, very loyal senators. They’re very loyal people. “Sir, cut him loose. He’s
killing us, sir. Cut him loose, sir.” | must’ve gotten half of the senators. | said, “No, | can’t do that. It’s
unfair to him. And it’s unfair to the family. He didn’t do anything wrong. They’re made-up stories. They
were all made-up stories. He didn’t do anything wrong.” “Cut him loose, sir.” | said, “No, | won’t do
that.” We got him through. And you know what? They couldn’t give a damn. They couldn’t give a damn.
Let them rule the right way, but it almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us,
and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.

You know, | read a story in one of the newspapers recently, how | control the three Supreme Court
justices. | control them. They’re puppets. | read it about Bill Barr, that he’s my personal attorney. That
he’ll do anything for me. And | said, “You know, it really is genius,” because what they do is that, and it
makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed,
if you hadn’t noticed. | like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn’t want to be considered my
personal attorney. And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the
story is | haven’t spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in. But the story is that
they’re my puppet. That they’re puppets. And now that the only way they can get out of that, because
they hate that, it’s not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump.
So let’s rule against Trump, and they do that. So | want to congratulate them.

But it shows you the media’s genius. In fact, probably, if | was the media, I’d do it the same way. | hate
to say it. But we got to get them straightened out. Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of
our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You
want to hear it?

In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats made illegal and
unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state
legislatures, that these changes paved the way for fraud on a scale never seen before. And | think we’d
go a long way outside of our country when | say that.

So just in a nutshell, you can’t make a change on voting for a federal election unless the state legislature
approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it, only a legislature. So as an example in Pennsylvania or
whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of
 Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature, the legislature laughs at them. Says, “We’re not
going to do that.” They say, “Thank you very much.” And they go and make the changes themselves.
They do it anyway. And that’s totally illegal. That’s totally illegal. You can’t do that.

In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally
abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election. So think of what
they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that’s OK. We want voter ID, by the way. But no
longer is there signature verification, 11 days before the election! They say, “We don’t want it.” You
know why they don’t want it? Because they want to cheat. That’s the only reason. Who would even
think of that? We don’t want to verify a signature? There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in
Pennsylvania. Now think of this. You had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had
200 -- where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody’s imagination.
Whatever they needed. So in Pennsylvania you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters! And it’s --
the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a
mathematical impossibility, unless you want to say it’s a total fraud. So Pennsylvania was defrauded.
Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match
individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people! Lots of dead people,
thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more. Not
only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago died. It’s
incredible.

Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters. So these are voters that don’t live in the state. And
by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome determinative. Meaning these numbers far
surpass -- | lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive. Massive. More than 10,000 votes in
Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words,
“They were received after Election Day, let’s count them anyway!” And what they did in many cases is
they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back, so that it no longer is after Election Day. And
more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were
ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it! Which is also
logically and logistically impossible, right? Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let’s send the
ballots. Oh, they’ve already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. | don’t think
that’s too good.

Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single
giant batch -- not legal -- indicating an enormous illegal ballot-harvesting operation. You’re not allowed
to do it. It’s against the law. The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number
of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by
400,000 people. It was increased. Nobody knows where it came from -- by 400,000 ballots. One day
after the election, it remains totally unexplained. They said, “Well, we can’t figure that.” Now that’s
many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. 400,000 ballots
appeared from nowhere, right after the election.

By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn’t know because it was so quick. They had a
vote, they voted, but now they see all this stuff. It’s all come to light. Doesn’t happen that fast. And they
want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence
agrees to send it back.
 Mike Pence has to agree to send it back. And many people in Congress want it sent back, and think of
what you’re doing. Let’s say you don’t do it. Somebody says, “Well, we have to obey the Constitution.”
And you are, because you’re protecting our country and you’re protecting the Constitution, so you are.
But think of what happens. Let’s say they’re stiffs and they’re stupid people. And they say, “Well, we
really have no choice.” Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes, they want
to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly and they want to redo their
legislature because many of these votes were taken, as | said, because it wasn’t approved by their
legislature. That in itself is illegal and then you have the scam and that’s all of the things that we’re
talking about. But think of this: If you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United
States for four years, with his wonderful son.

You will have a president who lost all of these states, or you will have a president, to put it another way,
who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these things. You will have an illegitimate
president, that’s what you'll have. And we can’t let that happen. These are the facts that you won’t hear
from the fake news media. It’s all part of the suppression effort. They don’t want to talk about it. They
don’t want to talk about it. In fact, when | started talking about that, | guarantee you a lot of the
television sets and a lot of those cameras went off and that’s how a lot of cameras back there. But a lot
of them went off, but these are the things you don’t hear about. You don’t hear what you just heard.
And I’m going to go over a few more states. But you don’t hear it by the people who want to deceive
you and demoralize you and control you -- big tech, media.

Just like the suppression polls that said we’re going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won
Wisconsin. They don’t have it that way because they lose just by a little sliver. But they had me down
the day before. Washington Post/ABC poll: down 17 points. | called up a real pollster. | said, “What is
that?” “Sir, that’s called a suppression poll. | think you’re going to win Wisconsin, sir.” | said, “But why
do they make it 4 or 5 points?” “Because then people vote. But when you’re down 17, they say, ‘Hey,
I’m not going to waste my time. | love the President, but there’s no way.’ ” Despite that, despite that, we
won Wisconsin. We’re going to see. We’re going to see. But that’s called suppression because a lot of
people, when they see that, it’s very interesting. This pollster said, “Sir, if you’re down 3, 4 or 5, people
vote. When you go down 17, they say, ‘Let’s save, let’s go and have dinner, and let’s watch the
presidential defeat tonight on television darling.’ ”

And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media, every time | put out a tweet, even if it’s
totally correct, totally correct, | get a flag. | get a flag. And they also don’t let you get out. On Twitter, it’s
very hard to come onto my account. It’s very hard to get out a message. They don’t let the message get
out nearly like they should, but I’ve had many people say, “I can’t get on your Twitter.” | don’t care
about Twitter. Twitter is bad news. They’re all bad news. But you know what? If you want to get out of
message, and if you want to go through big tech, social media, they are really, if you’re a conservative, if
you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, | guess they call it shadow ban, right? Shadow ban. They
shadow ban you, and it should be illegal. I’ve been telling these Republicans get rid of Section 230.

And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don’t want to put it in there. And they don’t realize that
that’s going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it’s never going to be the end of us,
never. Let them get out. Let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength. They also want to
indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren’t so. They want to indoctrinate
your children. It’s all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy and the American people to
finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it. | did no advertising. | did
 nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. | want to thank that -- Amy [Kremer] and
everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible, but we didn’t do anything. This just
happened.

Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. | said, “What are they there for?”
“Sir, they're there for you.” We have nothing to do with it. These groups, they’re forming all over the
United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you’re going to start working on Congress.
And we got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the
world, we got to get rid of them. We got to get rid -- you know, she never wants a soldier brought home.
l’ve brought a lot of our soldiers home. | don’t know, some like it. They’re in countries that nobody even
knows the name. Nobody knows where they are. They’re dying. They’re great, but they’re dying. They’re
losing their arms, their legs, their face. | brought them back home, largely back home, Afghanistan, Iraq.
Remember | used to say in the old days, “Don’t go into Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil.” We didn’t
keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid, these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the
bank. And what did we do? We get nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here. We
did good. We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows
and the rebuilding of our military in three years, people said it couldn’t be done. And it was all made in
the USA, all made in the USA. Best equipment in the world. In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat run cities
deployed more than 500 illegal unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000
unlawful votes. It was razor thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need, but
there are many things.

They have these lockboxes and they pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say,
“Where’s that box?” They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was. In addition, over
170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they
had a vote, but they had no application. And that’s illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were
blatantly done in opposition to state law. And they came 100% from Democrat areas, such as Milwaukee
and Madison, 100%. In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know
what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffel bags on park
benches across the city in complete defiance of cease and desist letters from state legislatures. Your
state legislature said, “Don’t do it.” They’re the only ones that could approve it. They gave tens of
thousands of votes.

They came in, in duffel bags. Where the hell did they come from? According to eyewitness testimony,
postal service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000
ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone
wins us the state. Great state, we love the state, we won the state. In Georgia, your secretary of state,
who -- | can’t believe this guy’s a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. | thought it
was a great conversation personally, so did a lot of other -- people love that conversation, because it
says what’s going on. These people are crooked. They’re 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt
between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night, just take a
look at what happened, what a mess. And the Democrat party operatives entered into an illegal and
unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other
election security procedures.

Stacey Abrams, she took them to lunch. And | beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp.
But they took -- the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue
what the hell was happening, unless he did have a clue. That’s interesting. Maybe he was with the other
 side, but we’ve been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County. They won’t let us do it.
The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn’t
they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt? They won't do it.
They go to some other county where you would live. | said, “That’s not the problem. The problem is
Fulton County.” Home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job. | congratulate her, but it was done in such
a way that we can’t let this stuff happen.

We won't have a country if it happens. As a result, Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate was more
than 10 times lower than previous levels, because the criteria was so off. Forty-eight counties in Georgia
with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots. There wasn’t one ballot. In other words, in
a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail
for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before. The only way this
can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That’s the only way
you could explain it. By the way, you’re talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected
the same number of unlawful ballots, as in other years, there should have been approximately 45,000
ballots rejected -- far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000.

They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that’s all we
need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we’re not going to forget it. There’s only one
reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, oppose voter ID and stop
citizenship confirmation. Are you a citizenship? (sic) You’re not allowed to ask that question. Because
they want to steal the election. The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless and
it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, | hope you’re going to stand up for the
good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very
disappointed in you. | will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories. In Fulton County, Republican
poll watchers were ejected, in some cases physically, from the room under the false pretense of a pipe
burst.

Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials pulled
boxes -- Democrats -- and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television. Totally
fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of
votes, as that coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none
for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m. The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic
governor of Georgia -- although he says, I’m a great president. You know, | sort of maybe have to -- He
said the other day, “Yes, | disagree with (the) president but he’s been a great president.” OK. Thank you
very much. Because of him and others -- Brian Kemp, vote him the hell out of office, please.

Well, his rates are so low, his approval rating now, | think it just reached a record low. They’ve rejected
five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even
without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we’ve identified across the state is staggering.
Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia
residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election. More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals
whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not
allowed to vote. More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the
state’s own voter rolls. Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using
an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service. At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast
by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.
 Sixty-six thousand votes -- each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in
Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age. And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by
individuals who moved out of the state prior to (the) November 3 election. They say they moved right
back. They move right back. Oh, they moved out. They moved right back. OK. They miss Georgia that
much. | do. | love Georgia, but it’s a corrupt system. Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only
11,779 votes. Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big,
beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election stolen from you, from me and from the country. And
not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should
absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.

In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two-thousand ballots
were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever
supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven’t mailed them yet. Eleven thousand six hundred
more ballots and votes were counted more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have
more votes, again, than you have voters.

One hundred fifty thousand people registered in (Maricopa) County after the registration deadline. One
hundred three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican
observers. In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were
purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots. If you signed your name as
Santa Claus, it would go through. There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,
O00 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose
names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020, prior to (the) November 3 election.
More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn’t live there. The
margin in Nevada is down at a very low number. Any of these things would have taken care of the
Situation.

We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we’re going over, we win. In Michigan quickly, the
secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications, sent to
every person on the rolls, in direct violation of state law. More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast
by individuals whose names and dates of birth matched people who were deceased. In Wayne County --
that’s a great one, that’s Detroit -- 174,000 ballots were counted without being tied to an actual
registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from. Also in Wayne County, poll watchers observed
canvassers re-scanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times. In
Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit
voting. This is in Michigan -- Detroit, Michigan.

A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed
city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat, while accompanying them to watch who they
voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn’t talk to him. The same worker was instructed not
to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She (was)
also told to illegally and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that
thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That’s Michigan. Four witnesses have
testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been
counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one
was for a Democrat. | got no votes.
 At 6:31 a.m., in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000
votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a
couple of percentage points went to Trump. Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only
observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary. You know
what’s interesting, President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden
killed him. But the swing States were the ones that mattered. There were always just enough to push
Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within the number of hours we were losing
by a little.

In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county
alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of
states in our country. Sen. William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee, Senator Ligon, highly respected on elections has written a letter describing his concerns
with Dominion in Georgia.

He wrote, and | quote, “The Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical
and astounding 93.67% error rate.” It’s only wrong 93% of the time. “In the scanning of ballots requiring
a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter’s interest, in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of
113,000.” Think of it, you go in and you vote and then they tell people who you’re supposed to be voting
for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody’s ever even heard. They adjudicate your vote. They say,
“Well, we don’t think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down
for Biden.” The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you’re at 93%. “The
source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or
destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.”

The letter continues, “There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from
President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia. For example, in Bibb
County, President Trump was reported to have 29, 391 votes at 9:11 PM eastern time. While
simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the
next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden
going way up to 29,391.” And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch, all in Mr. Biden’s favor.

So, | mean, | could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state and all of these
legislatures want this back. | don’t want to do it to you because | love you and it’s freezing out here, but |
could just go on forever. | can tell you this.

So when you hear, when you hear, “While there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,” this is the
most fraudulent thing anybody’s -- This is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise and the
press will say, and I’m sure they won't put any of that on there because that’s no good, do you ever see,
“While there is no evidence to back President Trump’s assertion,” | could go on for another hour reading
this stuff to you and telling you about it. There’s never been anything like it. Think about it, Detroit had
more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more -- but you don’t
have to go any -- Between that, | think that’s almost better than dead people, if you think, right? More
votes than they had voters, and many other States are also.

It’s a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote
without so much as even showing identification. In no state is there any question or effort made to
 verify the identity, citizenship, residency, or eligibility of the votes cast. The Republicans have to get
tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so
straight, they want to play so, “Sir, yes, the United States, the Constitution doesn’t allow me to send
them back to the States.” Well, | say, “Yes, it does because the Constitution says you have to protect our
country and you have to protect our Constitution and you can’t vote on fraud, and fraud breaks up
everything, doesn’t it?” When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different
rules. So | hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And | hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs
and the stupid people that he’s listening to. It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed
full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise
ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don’t want to
clean them up. They are loaded. And how many people here know other people that when the hundreds
of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and | heard one who got
seven ballots. And then they say, “You didn’t quite make it, sir.” We won. We won in a landslide. This
was a landslide.

They said, “It’s not American to challenge the election.” This is the most corrupt election in the history,
maybe of the world. You know, you could go (to) Third World countries, but | don’t think they had
hundreds of thousands of votes and they don’t have voters for them. | mean, no matter where you go,
nobody would think this. In fact, it’s so egregious, it’s so bad, that a lot of people don’t even believe it.
It’s so crazy that people don’t even believe it. It can’t be true. So they don’t believe it. This is not just a
matter of domestic politics, this is a matter of national security. So today, in addition to challenging the
certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping
election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. Today is not the end. It’s just the
beginning.

With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our
country and nobody even challenges that. | say that over and over, and | never get challenged by the
fake news, and they challenge almost everything we say. But our fight against the big donors, big media,
big tech and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There’s never been a movement
like that. You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It’s hard to believe. We must
stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can
never be allowed to happen again, but we’re going forward. We’ll take care of going forward. We got to
take care of going back. Don’t let them talk, “OK, well we promise,” I’ve had a lot of people, “Sir, you’re
at 96% for four years.” | said, “I’m not interested right now. I’m interested in right there.”

With your help we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash your
check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show
an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote. We will also require proof of American
citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one,
actually. We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant
fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. There for, they get -- they disappear and then all of a sudden
they show up. It’s fraudulent. We will stop the practice of universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting. We will
clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who cast a vote is a citizen of our country, a
resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner. We will
restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed
when they make their choice. We will finally hold big tech accountable and if these people had courage
and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in
America, in the world, has.
 All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections and it has to
be stopped and the Republicans have to get a lot tougher and so should the Democrats. They should be
regulated, investigated and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They’re totally
breaking the law. Together we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in
our nation’s capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it’s easy, it’s a dirty business. It’s a dirty
business. You have a lot of bad people out there. Despite everything we’ve been through, looking out all
over this country and seeing fantastic crowds, although this | think is our all-time record. | think you
have 250,000 people. Two hundred fifty thousand!

Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, | have never been more confident in our nation’s
future. Well, | have to say we have to be a little bit careful. That’s a nice statement, but we have to bea
little careful with that statement. If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country,
because it’s illegal when the votes are illegal, when the way they got there is illegal, when the States
that vote are given false and fraudulent information. We are the greatest country on Earth and we are
headed, and were headed, in the right direction. You know, the wall is built. We’re doing record
numbers at the wall. Now they want to take down the wall. Let’s let everyone flow in. Let’s let
everybody flow in.

We did a great job in the wall. Remember the wall? They said it could never be done. One of the largest
infrastructure projects we’ve ever had in this country and it’s had a tremendous impact and we got rid
of catch and release, we got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with. But now the caravans, they
think Biden’s getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our
country. Can’t let it happen. As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We
have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country. We have overwhelming
pride in this great country, and we have it deep in our souls. Together we are determined to defend and
preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.

Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements still wait. | think one of our great
achievements will be election security because nobody until | came along, had any idea how corrupt our
elections were. And again, most people would stand there at 9:00 in the evening and say, “I want to
thank you very much,” and they go off to some other life, but | said, “Something’s wrong here.
Something’s really wrong. Can’t have happened.” And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight
like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.

Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our
movement, for our children and for our beloved country, and | say this, despite all that’s happened, the
best is yet to come.

So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, | love Pennsylvania Avenue, and
we’re going to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give -- the Democrats are hopeless. They’re never
voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones,
because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride
and boldness that they need to take back our country.

So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. | want to thank you all. God bless you and God bless America.
Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the
Union Address as Prepared for Delivery
The United States Capitol
Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.
Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.
Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme
Court.
And you, my fellow Americans.
I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the
new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.
I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the
first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.
Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch
McConnell.
And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority
Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.
And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be
considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.
The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving
forward. Of never giving up.
A story that is unique among all nations.
We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than
when we entered it.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
That is what we are doing again.
Two years ago, our economy was reeling.
As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more
jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.
Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and
robbed us of so much.
Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.
And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil
War.
Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.
As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great
American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask
me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.
You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work
together.
But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.
Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to
go it alone.
But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.
Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.
Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building
bridges to connect our nation and people.
Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans
exposed to toxic burn pits.
In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From
reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count
Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry
the person you love.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress,
there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.

The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power
for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.
And that’s always been my vision for our country.

To restore the soul of the nation.

To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.

To unite the country.

We’ve been sent here to finish the job.

For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.

Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at
home closed down.

Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.
And along the way, something else was lost.

Pride. That sense of self-worth.

I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the
economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.

To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the
top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder
up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.

As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about
your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the
eye and say, “Honey -it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.

So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near
record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.

We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest
growth in 40 years.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing
again?

For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.

Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and
creating American jobs.

Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted
supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.

But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.

We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.

Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.

Food inflation is coming down.

Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay
has gone up.

Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to
start anew small business.

Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.

And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small
businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.

Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and
possibility.

Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that
power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These
chips were invented right here in America.

America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.

But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing
only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip
factories overseas shut down.

Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers
couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.

Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.

We can never let that happen again.

That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.

We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.

We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.

With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across

the country.

That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300

billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.

Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a

thousand acres — a literal field of dreams.

That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the

factories are finished.

Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.

Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.

And it’s just getting started.

Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that

will come to life.

Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’II tell

you what this means to their communities.

We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.

But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best

infrastructure in the world.

We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President
Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.

Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from

Boston to Atlanta to Portland.

These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding

our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and

high-speed internet across America.

Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.

And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who

voted for the law.

And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund

projects in their districts, don’t worry.

I promised to be the president for all Americans.

We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.

This law will help further unite all of America.

Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over

the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.

One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of

freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but

we’re finally going to get it done.

I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to

deliver $1.6 billion for this project.

While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.

For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as

the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.

Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that

new bridge. That’s pride.

That’s what we’re also building — Pride.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and
400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink
clean water.

We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-
speed internet.

No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can
do their homework online.

And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.

Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past
administrations have found ways to get around it.

Not anymore.

Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction
materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.
American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.

And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American
highways will be made with American products.

My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been
forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many
people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.

Maybe that’s you, watching at home.

You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even
exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.
I get it.

That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.

Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made
in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and
make a real difference in your lives.

For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling,
wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick,

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 7/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
or if something happens to you.
Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the
house?
I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking
on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep
better at night.
You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on
Earth.
For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.
Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay
alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10
a vial to make.
But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars — and
making record profits.
Not anymore.
We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.
But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare,
including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to
save their lives.
Let’s finish the job this time.
Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.
This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a
maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive
cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.
If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay
Medicare back the difference.
And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices.
Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 8/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars
on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.

Why wouldn’t we want to do that?

Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction
Act.

Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription
drugs, I will veto it.

I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever
in history.

A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.
Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their
premiums.

But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.

Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to
those left off Medicaid.

Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever
to tackle the climate crisis.

Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world toa
clean energy future.

I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms
and wildfires.

In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we
are rebuilding for the long term.

New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.

Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.

Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left
behind.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 9/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the
country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.

And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the

purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.

Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.

Let’s face reality.

The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential

threat.

We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. ’'m

proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.

But there’s so much more to do.

We will finish the job.

And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the

wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.

I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.

And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is

simply unfair.

The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40

billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?

That’s simply not fair.

But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a

minimum of 15%.

Just 15%.

That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.

Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an

additional penny in taxes.

Nobody. Not one penny.
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 10/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
But there’s more to do.
Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a
billionaire minimum tax.
Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher ora
firefighter.
You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.
Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.
It’s outrageous.
They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and
keep gas prices down.
Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock,
rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.
Corporations ought to do the right thing.
That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks
to encourage long term investments instead.
They will still make a considerable profit.
Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to
avoid paying their taxes.
Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law
that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax
cheats.
That’s being fiscally responsible.
In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7
trillion - the largest deficit reduction in American history.
Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years ina
row.
Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national
debt in any four years than my predecessor.
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 11/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to
accumulate, was added by that administration alone.

How did Congress respond to all that debt?

They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.

They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.

Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.

Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States

of America will never, ever be questioned.

Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I

agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their

plans are.

Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want

Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.

That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go

away.

Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let

America default on its debt for the first time in our history.

I won’t let that happen.

Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.

Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they

started working.

So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we

will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.

Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.

If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to

cut Medicare, I will stop them.

I will not allow them to be taken away.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.
Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer
their plan.
We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.
My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.
I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.
In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.
I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay
for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big
corporations begin to pay their fair share.
Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax
code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.
Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already
preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills,
stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.
We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing
homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they
don’t need.
Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can
finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.
Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.
Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making
you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.
I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American
farmers, businesses, and consumers.
Let’s finish the job.
Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent
big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too
many businesses use to make you pay more.

For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and

refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.

We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than

$1 billion a year.

We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.

Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in

homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.

They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.

I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away

with it.

Not anymore.

We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.

We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees

can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.

We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to

$200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.

We'll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make

companies disclose all fees upfront.

And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just

to sit together.

Baggage fees are bad enough - they can’t just treat your child like a piece of

luggage.

Americans are tired of being played for suckers.

Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.

For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Not anymore.
We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.
For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when
they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the
same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.
Not anymore.
We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers
and pay them what they’re worth.
I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers
from organizing.
Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s
guarantee all workers a living wage.
Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick
days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable
millions more people to go to work.
Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of
parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level
in history.
And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We
increase economic growth.
Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality
housing.
Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so.
And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking
after their loved ones.
Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care
services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.
These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.
Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable
ticket to the middle class.

When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it
made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.

But the world has caught up.

Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates

us will out-compete us.”

Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition

for the 21st Century.

If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job

by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.

Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely

to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their

background.

Let’s give public school teachers a raise.

And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell

Grants for working- and middle-class families.

Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high

school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career

training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.

Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to

college or not.

And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s

also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.

While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people,

we have broken COVID’s grip on us.

COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.

We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.

And soon we'll end the public health emergency.

But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many.

More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.

Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.
We remember them, and we remain vigilant.

We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and
treatments.

So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.

And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on
prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and
small businesses afloat during the pandemic.

Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars
were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.

Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered
billions of taxpayer dollars.

Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals,
double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity
fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American
people.

For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten
times as much.

COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year
of the pandemic.

We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.

Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.
Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just
last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a
child.

But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.

Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from
walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.

I’ve never had to have the talk with my children - Beau, Hunter, and Ashley -
that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.

If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for

your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.

Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.

Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the

courage to carry on and speak out.

With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good

will come from this.”

Imagine how much courage and character that takes.

It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.

We all want the same thing.

Neighborhoods free of violence.

Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.

Our children to come home safely.

Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other

in America.

And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask

them to do too much.

To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug

overdoses, mental health crises, and more.

We ask too much of them.

I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time

they put on that shield.

But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.

We have to do better.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards,
and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.

We also need more first responders and other professionals to address
growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.

More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community
intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job
training.

All this can help prevent violence in the first place.

And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must
hold them accountable.

With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law
enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning
chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the
George Floyd Act.

Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true,
something good must come from this.

All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.

We can’t turn away.

Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.

Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.

Do something.

That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do
something on gun violence.

Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three
decades.

That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support,
like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws
keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and
others.

But we know our work is not done.
Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.
Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying
from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.
Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s
front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.
He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.
In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic
pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance
studio.
He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.
Ban assault weapons once and for all.
We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.
In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After
Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.
Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.
And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue
like it was before.
We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border,
arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl
in just the last several months.
Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from
Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.
But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.
If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my
plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a
pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm
workers, and essential workers.

Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and
freedoms.

Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and

codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.

The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to

reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more

than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.

Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.

Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans,

especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.

Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our

example. Let’s remember the world is watching.

I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin

unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.

A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe

suffered in World War II.

Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the

world.

Would we stand for the most basic of principles?

Would we stand for sovereignty?

Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?

Would we stand for the defense of democracy?

For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents

open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity.

One year later, we know the answer.

Yes, we would.

And yes, we did.

Together, we did what America always does at our best.

We led.
We united NATO and built a global coalition.
We stood against Putin’s aggression.
We stood with the Ukrainian people.
Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United
States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.
Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand
with you as long as it takes.
Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace,
not just in Europe, but everywhere.
Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of
China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.
Not anymore.
I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.
I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong.
Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future,
and that China’s government is intent on dominating.
Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our
advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.
Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.
Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or
anyone else in the world.
I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests
and benefit the world.
But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our
sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.
And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us.
We face serious challenges across the world.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.
Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.

America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate
and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.
Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.

And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the
Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong
they are.

It’s never a good bet to bet against America.

When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was
impossible. But I never believed it.

That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.

We’ve made real progress.

Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective
treatments for opioid addiction.

Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.
Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer,
Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.

We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war
veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.
But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.

Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.
He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh.
Her sister’s best friend.

He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.

Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and
eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/ 23/28
 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
She was 20 years old.
Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse
pain.”
Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and
change laws.
He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”
Doug, we’re with you.
Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.
Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking,
with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and
powder at the border.
Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong
penalties to crack down on fentany] trafficking.
Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When
millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we
owe them greater access to mental health care at school.
We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment
they are running on our children for profit.
And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting
personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to
children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies
collect on all of us.
Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip
those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when
they come home.
Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return
to civilian life.
Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this
country, especially not those who served it.
And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health
screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other
veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.
And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President
Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.

Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years.

Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide

more support for patients and families.

It’s personal for so many of us.

Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of

immigrants from Panama.

They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same

chapel as Jill and I did.

Kindred spirits.

He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.

She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.

26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney

removed.

A 5% survival rate.

He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”

Jill and I understand, like so many of you.

They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to

steal moments of joy where you can.

For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant

everything.

They never gave up hope.

Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.

They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer
free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.

For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly
American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves
that we can do big things.

Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless
advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR
to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.

I believe we can do the same with cancer.

Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.
There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy
itself.

It’s the most fundamental thing of all.

With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.

For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put
at risk.

Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.

And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant
unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of
Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who
stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.

Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal
attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.

My friend, Paul Pelosi.

But such a heinous act never should have happened.

We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In
America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental
right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the
people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our
institutions of democracy.

 22/01/2024, 16:51 Remarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address as Prepared for Delivery | The White House
And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.
Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.
Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been
called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.
And this is our moment.
My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those
moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make
now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to
come.
We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that
confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of
our time and the time for choosing is at hand.
We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful.
Forward-looking.
A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over
division. Stability over chaos.
We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a
good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.
That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation
that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.
So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of
the union. And here is my report.
Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation
is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union
is strong.
As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of
America. We just have to remember who we are.
We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing
beyond our capacity if we do it together.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.
