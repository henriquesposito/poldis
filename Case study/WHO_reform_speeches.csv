"1","Spahn: Globale Herausforderungen lassen sich nur zusammen angehen","Professor Ganten,  Professor Ali Jafarian,  Excellencies,  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,  Every year, the World Health Summit gives us the opportunity to pause for a second and review what we have achieved.  Where do we stand right now?  Polio has almost been eradicated,  HIV/AIDS have been driven back, and  we have managed to cut overall infant mortality worldwide by half.  These are positive developments, but one question remains: is this where we want to be?  My answer is “no”.  The world’s health status is less than satisfactory.  Let me give you some examples:  NCDs (non-communicable diseases), such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease are globally on the rise: almost 15 million premature deaths every year, not only in low- and middle-income countries, but also in high-income countries.  As for pandemic preparedness: we all know that the world will face another pandemic. The only thing we do not know is when it will happen and how severe it will be.  Is the world well-prepared for this? If we look at the robustness of health systems worldwide, and the implementation of the International Health Regulations’ core capacities, we have to confess: No, the world is certainly not adequately prepared!  Today, more than 1.6 billion people live in areas where protracted crises and weak healthcare systems leave them without access to basic healthcare.  And every year, 700,000 people die of AMR.  I could go on and on with the list of pressing health challenges.  Indeed, it is true that we have agreed to address them with the Agenda 2030.  However, we are far from reaching the health-related SDGs, and will fall even further behind if we carry on with “business as usual”.  We have ten years in which to fulfil our ambitious agenda. So we have to intensify our efforts, embrace true commitment for global health and work in partnership – across all sectors and stakeholder groups.  Ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great honour for me to open this year’s World Health Summit.  The summit brings together all the relevant actors who contribute to SDG 3:  politicians, scientists, think tanks, representatives of the private sector and civil society from all over the world.  It is our strong belief that global challenges can only be addressed jointly.  As stakeholders from different disciplines and different organisations, we are diverse in our resources and in our strengths. And this is exactly what allows us to thrive and make progress in finding the right answers.  Last month, the UN High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage in New York, saw the launch of the “Global Action Plan for healthy lives and well-being for all”.  Having participated in the event myself, it was an impressive political signal to see twelve organisations commit to streamlining their contributions into a structured process to attain the health-related SDGs.  This clearly shows that, when the vision is clear and expectations are high:  we can ignore our vanity,  we can ignore competition for resources and  we can ignore our way of doing business as usual and find new solutions.  I would like to extend my gratitude to the twelve organisations, and WHO, for its leadership in this process.  The launch of the Global Action Plan was just the starting point. Now, implementation at country level is key:  milestones have to be defined and  all agencies have to stick to their commitments and work hand in hand.  Let’s make sure that, in 2023, the review shows we are on track.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  The SDG 3 Action Plan initiative is a clear political statement that Germany truly believes in constructive multilateralism.  More than other countries, Germany has profited from a relatively stable, rules-based international order over the past 70 years. For us, living in peace, economic prosperity, and an open society is directly linked to rules-based, multilateral cooperation.  All key global health challenges call for multilateral action based on partnership and often grounded in a regulatory framework.  Thus, it is a key priority for overall German policy, including our global health policy, to contribute to the preservation of this order, to further develop it in partnership with others and to promote multilateral cooperation.  It is in this context, that we see our commitment and leadership in fora like the G7 and G20.  And Germany has also shown strong commitment for organisations like the Global Fund (to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria), which will be receiving one billion euros in support over the next three years from the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Our understanding of constructive multilateralism in global health also explains our strong commitment to the relevant international organizations, in particular the World Health Organization, and our full support for it – politically, financially, technically and through our involvement in its governing bodies.  So as to gain a better understanding of the progress of WHO’s emergency reform, as well as a more general overview of the broader health challenges facing Africa, I visited four African countries three weeks ago.  This was, for me, a very impressive experience.  It goes without saying that I needed to see for myself the effects of the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, show our support to the communities affected and learn how we – the international community – can better support the response to health emergencies. As a result of this visit, I committed an additional support to WHO’s Contingency Fund. And, Germany has also committed to support the African CDC.  What I have also seen is that Ebola is only the tip of the iceberg. Most people are dying from easily treatable and avoidable diseases such as measles or malaria. Even simple interventions such as immunisation still remain a huge challenge for weak and underfinanced healthcare systems. Of course every country would still need to allocate adequate resources to its own healthcare system.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Good Global Health starts at home. As a health minister I have homework to do as well.  In Germany, we have the potential to increase our immunisation rates. That is why I have submitted a draft law on protection against measles and strengthening immunisation. The draft law obliges all children entering school or kindergarten to be vaccinated against the disease.  An area that is close to my heart is harnessing the digital revolution. I will make sure that the electronic patient record (“Elektronische Patientenakte”) will be available to the population in Germany by 2021. Everyone will be able to access their personal medical data and make it available to their doctors.  In addition, telemedicine and artificial intelligence will contribute to further improving health in underserved regions.  Prior to this, the core ethical issue is how to make the best use of the potential of Big Data and AI for the individual and common good, while ensuring both self-determination and solidarity, the right to privacy and the enhancement of individual responsibility and patients’ capacities.  While a lot of innovation is underway, governance is needed to create a trustworthy framework for digitalisation, especially with regard to standardisation and data availability.  We thus support the call for international cooperation and coherence. Both are necessary if we want to achieve a value-based digital health ecosystem.  Ladies and gentlemen,  In the second half of 2020, Germany will take over the EU Presidency for six months.  The main focus of our presidency in 2020 will be digitalisation, Big Data and AI.  Moreover, together with our trio partners, Portugal and Slovenia, we want to make the European voice in Global Health heard. The role of the EU in international fora, such as the World Health Organization, must be increased.  We are fortunate that next year’s Word Health Summit will take place during the German EU Presidency. This will be the perfect opportunity to discuss Global Health issues together with our trio presidency partners, as well as other European and international partners and friends.  I am looking forward to seeing you then.  Thank you very much!","27.10.2019","Germany","https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/themen/internationale-gesundheitspolitik/global/11-world-health-summit"
"2","Trump Ultimatum to the WHO","His Excellency THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON May 18, 2020 Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General of the World Health Organization Geneva, Switzerland Dear Dr. Tedros: On April 14, 2020, I suspended United States contributions to the World Health Organization pending an investigation by my Administration of the organization's failed response to the CO VID-19 outbreak. This review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization's alarming lack of independence from the People's Republic of China. Based on this review, we now know the following: • The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government's official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself. • By no later than December 30,2019, the World Health Organization office in Beijing knew that there was a ""major public health"" concern in Wuhan. Between December 26 and December 30, China's media highlighted evidence of a new virus emerging from Wuhan, based on patient data sent to multiple Chinese genomics companies. Additionally, during this period, Dr. Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China's health authorities that a new coronavirus was causing a novel disease that was, at the time, afflicting approximately 180 patients. • By the next day, Taiwanese authorities had communicated information to the World Health Organization indicating human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Yet the World Health Organization chose not to share any of this critical information with the rest of the world, probably for political reasons. • The International Health Regulations require countries to report the risk of a health emergency within 24 hours. But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan's several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier. • According to Dr. Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, he told Chinese authorities on January 5, 2020, that he had sequenced the genome of the virus. There was no publication of this information until six days later, on January 11, 2020, when Or. Zhang self-posted it online. The next day, Chinese authorities closed his lab for ""rectification."" As even the World Health Organization acknowledged, Or. Zhang's posting was a great act of ""transparency."" But the World Health Organization has been conspicuously silent both with respect to the closure of Or. Zhang's lab and his assertion that he had notified Chinese authorities of his breakthrough six days earlier. • The World Health Organization has repeatedly made claims about the coronavirus that were either grossly inaccurate or misleading. • On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization gratuitously reaftirmed China's now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between humans, stating: ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China."" This assertion was in direct conflict with censored reports from Wuhan. • On January 21, 2020, President Xi Jinping of China reportedly pressured you not to declare the corona virus outbreak an emergency. You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course. • On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, you praised the Chinese government for its ""transparency"" with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a ""new standard for outbreak control"" and ""bought the world time."" You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it. • Even after you belatedly declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, you failed to press China for the timely admittance of a World Health Organization team of international medical experts. As a result, this critical team did not arrive in China until two weeks later, on February 16, 2020. And even then, the team was not allowed to visit Wuhan until the final days of their visit. Remarkably, the World Health Organization was silent when China denied the two American members of the team access to Wuhan entirely. • You also strongly praised China's strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were ""causing more harm than good."" Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world. • As of February 3, 2020, China was strongly pressuring countries to lift or forestall travel restrictions. This pressure campaign was bolstered by your incorrect statements on that day telling the world that the spread of the virus outside of China was ""minimal and slow"" and that ""the chances of getting this going to anywhere outside China [were] very low."" • On March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that ""COVID- 19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza"" and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by ""people who are infected but not yet sick."" China's evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, ""showed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days."" Many experts, however, citing data from Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, vigorously questioned these assertions. It is now clear that China's assertions, repeated to the world by the World Health Organization, were wildly inaccurate. • By the time you finally declared the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020, it had killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 100,000 people in at least 114 countries around the world. • On April 11, 2020, several African Ambassadors wrote to the Chinese Foreign Ministry about the discriminatory treatment of Africans related to the pandemic in Guangzhou and other cities in China. You were aware that Chinese authorities were carrying out a campaign of forced quarantines, evictions, and refusal of services against the nationals of these countries. You have not commented on China's racially discriminatory actions. You have, however, baselessly labeled as racist Taiwan's well-founded complaints about your mishandling of this pandemic. • Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged ""transparency."" You have consistently joined in these tributes, notwithstanding that China has been anything but transparent. In early January, for example, China ordered samples of the virus to be destroyed, depriving the world of critical information. Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts.  • The World Health Organization has failed to publicly call on China to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, despite the recent endorsement for doing so by its own Emergency Committee. The World Health Organization's failure to do so has prompted World Health Organization member states to adopt the ""COYID-19 Response"" Resolution at this year's World Health Assembly, which echoes the call by the United States and so many others for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review of how the World Health Organization handled the crisis. The resolution also calls for an investigation into the origins of the virus, which is necessary for the world to understand how best to counter the disease. Perhaps worse than all these failings is that we know that the World Health Organization could have done so much better. Just a few years ago, under the direction of a different DirectorGeneral, the World Health Organization showed the world how much it has to offer. In 2003, in response to the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, DirectorGeneral Harlem Brundtland boldly declared the World Health Organization's first emergency travel advisory in 55 years, recommending against travel to and from the disease epicenter in southern China. She also did not hesitate to criticize China for endangering global health by attempting to cover up the outbreak through its usual play book of arresting whistleblowers and censoring media. Many lives could have been saved had you followed Dr. Brundtland's example. It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America's interests.","18.05.2020","United States","https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262577580718395393?s=20"
"3","Remarks by PM at the Opening Session of Second Global COVID Virtual Summit","President Biden Vice President Haris Excellencies, Namaskar! The Covid pandemic continues to disrupt lives, supply chains, and tests the resilience of open societies. In India, we adopted a people-centric strategy against the pandemic. We have made the highest ever allocation to our annual healthcare budget. Our vaccination programme is the largest in the world. We have fully vaccinated almost 90 percent of the adult population, and more than 50 million children. India manufactures four WHO approved vaccines and has the capacity to produce five billion doses this year. We supplied over 200 million doses to 98 countries, bilaterally and through COVAX. India has developed low-cost COVID mitigation technologies for testing, treating and data management. We have offered these capabilities to other countries. India’s Genomics Consortium has contributed significantly to the global database on the virus. I am happy to share that we will extend this network to countries in our neighborhood. In India, we extensively used our traditional medicines to supplement our fight against COVID and to boost immunity, saving countless lives. Last month, we laid the foundation of ”WHO Centre for Traditional Medicine” in India, with an aim to make this age-old knowledge available to the World. Excellencies, It is clear that a coordinated global response is required to combat future health emergencies. We must build a resilient global supply chain and enable equitable access to vaccines and medicines. WTO rules, particularly TRIPS need to be more flexible. WHO must be reformed and strengthened to build a more resilient global health security architecture. We also call for stream-lining WHO’s approval process for vaccines and therapeutics to keep supply chains stable and predictable. As a responsible member of the global community, India is ready to play a key role in these efforts. Thank you. Thank you very much.","12.05.2022","India","https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/remarks-by-pm-at-the-opening-session-of-second-global-covid-virtual-summit/"
"4","Message from French Président Emmanuel Macron of the 74th World Health Assembly.","Heads of State and Government,  Director-General of the World Health Organization, dear Tedros,  The pandemic isn't over, but we can already draw some lessons from it together. For more than a year now, we have all been fully committed to the daily management of this crisis. The time has come to draw lessons from it, and this discussion provides us the opportunity to do so.  The first lesson we may learn from this crisis, is that we can only succeed together.  No country can save the world alone, and no country can save itself alone. Every one of our citizens knows that this pandemic is global by nature. Global through the mechanisms of contamination, and in our responses.   The response, therefore, can only be multilateral - meaning the one international, cooperative response that connects the various levels, guided by the principle of subsidiarity.   At the national level, sovereign decisions and the organization of healthcare, which involves massive investment across all health systems;  At the regional level, decisive action in research, investment and planning – to do this, we established the EU4Health, and we will continue to strengthen it;  At the international level, coordination, monitoring and information-sharing, and solidarity.  On this last aspect, with our European partners, we put forward tangible proposals:  Firstly, we must have institutions that measure up to our ambitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) must be the heart of global health, acting as a compass.  The WHO must be robust in times of crisis, agile enough to respond in an emergency, resistant against pandemics, totally transparent to inspire trust, with clear and transparent governance to ensure it never comes under diplomatic pressure and cannot be suspected of being under any pressure of this kind. France supports the strengthening of the WHO in its normative role and in the preparations for and responses to future health crises.  In this respect, we must improve the financing of the WHO, so that it is more sustainable, predictable and less dependent on a few large donors.  We must also study proposals on the table today to significantly enhance the Organization's independence and authority.   Secondly, we must work collectively to strengthen the implementation of the International Health Regulations. To this end, I wanted France to take part in a peer-reviewed pilot phase of the Member States’ preparedness for pandemics. We must also give the WHO the possibility, through rapid response missions, to be present in the field as soon as the first signs of an epidemic appear.  I support the proposal to assign the WHO competence to conduct investigations on potential pandemic pathogens, which would give it swift access to all areas concerned. Transparency and data-sharing are absolutely essential.  Thirdly, the health crisis has reminded us that human health is inextricably linked to animal and environmental health. The famous “One Health” approach must guide our efforts to be better prepared for future pandemics. In this area, we have started to make progress. We launched it together in November 2020 in Paris. We must continue to design, develop and make this initiative a reality.   Lastly, and this topic is particularly important to me, the current pandemic, and all the disinformation that arose from it, has helped us to see the importance of science and robust health systems. Access to scientific data and reliable information, and informing the public and healthcare workers are essential to the current fight against the pandemic. They will be just as important when we come up against other major struggles in the years and decades to come.  That is why, in June 2019, we initiated the project for an Academy, alongside the World Health Organization, which would provide training on global health challenges for public leaders, business leaders and the lifeblood of global civil society.  Because healthcare, when founded on science, concerns us all.  Two years later, I am very pleased to announce, with you dear Doctor Tedros, that the World Health Academy has been launched.  France is committed to investing more than €120 million. It will become the leading global training structure in the area of public health. It will open in Lyon in 2023, but an initial catalogue of online courses will be available this summer.   France will fully participate in the upcoming negotiations on the reform of global health. To make rapid progress following this Assembly, the adoption of the resolution put forward by the European Union on the strengthening of the WHO's action in emergency health situations would send a strong first signal.  Likewise, I encourage you to approve the commencement of negotiations on the international treaty on pandemics.   We are moving forward, and we must. Those are my few words, the few beliefs I wanted to share with you, dear Tedros, dear all.  Rest assured of France's full commitment. Today and tomorrow.   Thank you.","24.05.2021","France","https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron/2021/05/24/message-from-french-president-emmanuel-macron-of-the-74th-world-health-assembly"
"5","Remarks by President Xi at Global Health Summit","Your Excellency Prime Minister Mario Draghi,  Your Excellency President Ursula von der Leyen,  Dear Colleagues,  It gives me great pleasure to attend the Global Health Summit. Last year, the G20 successfully held an Extraordinary Leaders' Summit on COVID-19 and the Riyadh Summit. Many important common understandings were reached on promoting global solidarity against the virus and boosting world economic recovery.  The past year and more have seen repeated resurgence and frequent mutations of the coronavirus. The most serious pandemic in a century is still wreaking havoc. To clinch an early victory against COVID-19 and restore economic growth remains the top priority for the international community. G20 members need to shoulder responsibilities in global cooperation against the virus. In the meantime, we need to draw on experience both positive and otherwise, and lose no time in remedying deficiencies, closing loopholes and strengthening weak links in a bid to enhance preparedness and capacity for coping with major public health emergencies. Here, I want to make five points on what we need to do.  First, we must put people and their lives first. The battle with COVID-19 is one for the people and by the people. What has happened proves that to completely defeat the virus, we must put people's lives and health front and center, demonstrate a great sense of political responsibility and courage, and make extraordinary responses to an extraordinary challenge. No effort must be spared to attend every case, save every patient, and truly respect the value and dignity of every human life. Meanwhile, it is also important to minimize the potential impact on people's life and maintain general order in our society.  Second, we must follow science-based policies and ensure a coordinated and systemic response. Faced with this new infectious disease, we should advocate the spirit of science, adopt a science-based approach, and follow the law of science. The fight against COVID-19 is an all-out war that calls for a systemic response to coordinate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, balance targeted routine COVID-19 protocols and emergency measures, and ensure both epidemic control and socio-economic development. G20 members need to adopt responsible macro-economic policies and step up coordination to keep the global industrial and supply chains safe and smooth. It is essential to give continued support by such means as debt suspension and development aid to developing countries, especially vulnerable countries facing exceptional difficulties.  Third, we must stick together and promote solidarity and cooperation. The pandemic is yet another reminder that we humanity rise and fall together with a shared future. Confronted by a pandemic like COVID-19, we must champion the vision of building a global community of health for all, tide over this trying time through solidarity and cooperation, and firmly reject any attempt to politicize, label or stigmatize the virus. Political manipulation would not serve COVID-19 response on the domestic front. It would only disrupt international cooperation against the virus and bring greater harm to people around the world.  Fourth, we must uphold fairness and equity as we strive to close the immunization gap. A year ago, I proposed that vaccines should be made a global public good. Today, the problem of uneven vaccination has become more acute. It is imperative for us to reject vaccine nationalism and find solutions to issues concerning the production capacity and distribution of vaccines, in order to make vaccines more accessible and affordable in developing countries. Major vaccine-developing and producing countries need to take up their responsibility to provide more vaccines to developing countries in urgent need, and they also need to support their businesses in joint research and authorized production with other countries having the relevant capacity. Multilateral financial institutions should provide inclusive financing support for vaccine procurement of developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) should speed up efforts under the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility.  Fifth, we must address both the symptoms and root causes as we improve the governance system. The pandemic is an extensive test of the global health governance system. It is important that we strengthen and leverage the role of the UN and the WHO and improve the global disease prevention and control system to better prevent and respond to future pandemics. It is important that we uphold the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, fully heed the views of developing countries, and better reflect their legitimate concerns. It is also important that we enhance our capacity of monitoring, early-warning and emergency response, our capacity of treatment of major pandemics, of contingency reserve and logistics, of fighting disinformation, and of providing support to developing countries.  Colleagues,  In this unprecedented battle against the pandemic, China has, while receiving support and help from many countries, mounted a massive global humanitarian operation. At the 73rd World Health Assembly held in May last year, I announced five measures that China would take to support global anti-pandemic cooperation. Implementation of those measures is well underway. Notwithstanding the limited production capacity and enormous demand at home, China has honored its commitment by providing free vaccines to more than 80 developing countries in urgent need and exporting vaccines to 43 countries. We have provided 2 billion US dollars in assistance for the COVID-19 response and economic and social recovery in developing countries hit by the pandemic. We have sent medical supplies to more than 150 countries and 13 international organizations, providing more than 280 billion masks, 3.4 billion protective suits and 4 billion testing kits to the world. A cooperation mechanism has been established for Chinese hospitals to pair up with 41 African hospitals, and construction for the China-assisted project of the Africa CDC headquarters officially started at the end of last year. Important progress has also been made in the China-UN joint project to set up in China a global humanitarian response depot and hub. China is fully implementing the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative for Poorest Countries and has so far put off debt repayment exceeding 1.3 billion US dollars, the highest deferral amount among G20 members.  In continued support for global solidarity against COVID-19, I wish to announce the following:  — China will provide an additional 3 billion US dollars in international aid over the next three years to support COVID-19 response and economic and social recovery in other developing countries.  — Having already supplied 300 million doses of vaccines to the world, China will provide still more vaccines to the best of its ability.  — China supports its vaccine companies in transferring technologies to other developing countries and carrying out joint production with them.  — Having announced support for waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, China also supports the World Trade Organization and other international institutions in making an early decision on this matter.  — China proposes setting up an international forum on vaccine cooperation for vaccine-developing and producing countries, companies and other stakeholders to explore ways of promoting fair and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world.  Colleagues,  The ancient Roman philosopher Seneca said, ""We are all waves of the same sea."" Let us join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder with each other to firmly advance international cooperation against COVID-19, build a global community of health for all, and work for a healthier and brighter future for humanity.","21.05.2021","China","http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202105/21/WS60a7bbcca31024ad0bac0b12.html"
"6","Statement by Dr GNM Pandor, Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, on the occasion of the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, 21 September 2022, United Nations, New York","President of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly, His Excellency Mr Csaba Kőrösi, Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr António Guterres, Excellencies Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr President, Let me join the speakers before me in congratulating you for your assumption of this important task. South Africa also congratulates your predecessor for his successful tenure as President of the General Assembly. We thank the Secretary-General for his continued stewardship of this important global body, the United Nations. Mr President, We meet at a time when the UN family is facing its greatest test. Member states have to work with the United Nations to develop effective responses to the current challenges. As the theme of the general assembly indicates, these are diverse, immense, yet interconnected challenges and no country can respond alone. Some have referred to this moment as a key turning point in history. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Eastern Europe shape our attitudes today; however, for South Africa, the real inflection point will be the world attending fully to the needs of the marginalised and forgotten. Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality, joblessness and feeling excluded. Acting on the Common Agenda vision 2021 of the UN Secretary General should become the major objective of this time because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will be the beginnings of the real inflection point in human history.     The Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration for Human Rights and its human rights protocols all commit us to protecting all people without distinction of any kind. We must acknowledge that we face these crises today because we have not always upheld these foundational principles consistently and fairly.     The COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with a roadmap on what should be done and not done to address global challenges. We should use the lessons learnt effectively. There were some noble initiatives such as the Access to COVID-19 tools Accelerator (ACT-A) that was co-chaired by President Ramaphosa, the African Union Champion for the COVID response, and the Prime Minister of Norway. This initiative laid the basis for a fairer distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.     Mr President,     Global solidarity is also required to meet other pressing challenges such as energy and food insecurity, climate change and the devastation caused by conflicts, including the existential threat of nuclear weapons.     Instead of working collectively to address these challenges, we have grown further apart as geopolitical tensions and mistrust permeate our relations.     We should, however, move forward in solidarity, united in efforts to address our common global challenges to ensure sustainable peace and development.     Mr President,     One of the tasks we must successfully implement to ensure developing countries are not left behind when treatments are available is to create and support research and innovation capacity in Africa for vaccine production, invest in strengthened public health systems and produce thousands more professional health workers. This requires sustainable investment in higher education, research institutions and in global research cooperation.     The mobilisation of resources and capabilities to strengthen the pandemic response and preparedness of all nations must be substantially increased. It will be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19.     We need to strengthen the global health architecture to ensure that we are better able to meet the challenges of new pandemics and other infectious diseases of concern. South Africa is proud to be part of this solution through the establishment of the first mRNA global technology transfer hubs that will contribute to the security of supply of life-saving medication for African countries and other developing countries.     Mr President,     South Africa, like many other developing countries, faces huge developmental challenges, including in our energy sector. We need to collectively address global energy shortages, including by deploying innovative solutions that are cheaper, cleaner and more accessible.     Working with international partners, we are developing our Just Energy Transition Plan to significantly reduce harmful emissions in South Africa. Work on an expanded green economy is also gaining significant momentum.     Mr President,     We commend the Secretary-General for focussing attention on transforming education. Education remains one of the most important drivers to end poverty and inequality, and we will work towards increasing the access to education that is affordable. South Africa has no-fee schools at primary and secondary school levels for the most vulnerable learners. There is also a state bursary for poor students who qualify for tertiary education. These measures have over the years served to increase the enrolment of leaners who were previously unable to access education.     In the field of research and innovation, we need more partnerships such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) science infrastructure project hosted in South Africa and Australia, which is an international partnership that is one of the largest scientific endeavours in history. Partnerships of this nature must be encouraged to leverage scientific breakthroughs for development purposes.     Mr President,     The multilateral trading system must be strengthened so that we genuinely create a conducive environment for fair trade that also provides opportunities for developing economies. If actionable steps such as these are not taken, developing countries will remain subject to an imbalanced global financial and trading system.     Mr President,     Using this moment of renewal, we reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as the only means to build a better world. The United Nations itself must be transformed so that it serves its role cognisant of current global dynamics. It is unacceptable that 77 years after its establishment, five nations wield disproportionate decision-making power in the United Nations system as a whole. Transformation of the UN must include more representative, transparent and accountable organs of global governance.     For the UN to be effective, the General Assembly must be revitalised and the Security Council must be reformed. We also cannot have a credible organisation if persistent transgressors of the Charter are not held accountable.     Mr President,     We must act immediately to protect the environment and the world we live in, for ourselves and for future generations. Whilst Africa is the least responsible for the climate crisis, it finds itself at the epicentre of its worst impacts. We should therefore emerge from COP27, in Egypt, with an agreement that contains enhanced and balanced actions on adaptation, mitigation and financing. This must take into account our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. In addition, we must agree on a mechanism for loss and damage.     In South Africa, our Cabinet has approved wide-reaching policies to ensure that we can meet our climate change targets. We have established a Presidential Climate Finance Task Team to lead and coordinate negotiations with the International Partner Group to give effect to the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP. The JETP seeks to address South Africa’s investment needs in infrastructure to facilitate our coal phase-down in a manner that ensures that no one is left behind.     Mr President,     Building a better world requires peace and stability.  South Africa continues to believe that conflict resolution must not come through fuelling conflicts, but through investing in efforts aimed at political dialogue. We should aspire to peace as a global public good. There have been no winners of the wars of the past seven decades. Instead, they engendered strife, distrust among nations, divisions, a perpetual misallocation of resources to weapons as well as increased poverty and underdevelopment.     While we work to address contemporary conflicts, we should not ignore long-standing ones such as Palestine that has been on the United Nations agenda throughout the seven decades of the existence of this organisation. We cannot ignore the words of the former Israeli negotiator at the Oslo talks, Daniel Levy, who addressed the UN Security Council recently and referred to “The increasingly weighty, body of scholarly, legal and public opinion that has designated Israel to be perpetrating apartheid in the territories under its control.”     Israel must be held accountable for its destructive actions that have significantly impaired the possibility of a two-state solution.     Similarly, we cannot ignore the decades-long struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We must treat all conflicts across the globe with equal indignation, no matter what the colour or creed of the people affected.     South Africa calls for an end to the embargo against Cuba, which continues to impede the right to development of her people. In the same vein, we call for an end to unilateral coercive measures against Zimbabwe, which have compounded the problems experienced by the people of Zimbabwe and have a detrimental effect on the broader Southern African region.     Mr President,     Our quest to build a better world will remain unfulfilled as long as people are still discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language.     We have a responsibility to make sure that every girl child receives an education and that every woman has an opportunity to work, to study, to start a business and to have choice and control over her life and body.     We need to end the violence perpetrated against the most vulnerable, most often women and children. We have witnessed that women in conflict situations are particularly vulnerable, including women journalists. The murder of Shireen Abu Akleh and otyer journalists is a stark reminder of the dangers that women in conflict situations face. We must do all we can to protect them, and hold those accountable for harming them.     We must also strengthen the capacity and draw on the voices of the youth on the African continent. In this regard, we need to harness the demographic dividend by maximising our investment in quality education as a means to address intergenerational poverty, together with inclusive economies.     Mr President     Africa is home to more than 1.3 billion people. It is fast emerging from centuries of colonialism, occupation and exploitation, from wilful neglect and under-development.     Through the African Continental Free Trade Area, the countries of Africa are laying a firm foundation for a new era of trade, commerce and productivity.     African countries are establishing the conditions for the seamless flow of goods and services between African markets, for the growth of industry and for the construction of the roads, bridges, railway lines, ports and power stations that will support growth.     As we continue our efforts to end war, conflict and insurgency in several parts of our continent and to prevent the unconstitutional seizure of power, we will continue to seek greater alignment between the agendas of the United Nations and our body, the African Union.     Mr President,     To overcome all these acutely global challenges, we must agree to a common path out of an increasingly polarised world. A rules-based international system, predicated on international law and strict adherence to the provisions of the UN Charter is essential. Such a system must safeguard the interests of all and not only the powerful countries.     We acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary-General through his vision contained in the report on ‘Our Common Agenda’, to provide us with options to be able to put aside our differences, build trust and forge a world where future generations will prosper and thrive.     I thank you.","21.09.2022","South Africa","https://dirco.gov.za/statement-by-dr-gnm-pandor-minister-of-international-relations-and-cooperation-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-debate-of-the-77th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly-21-september-2022-un/"
