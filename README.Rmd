Text data and tools for analysing on political discourses in time. 

There is one main reason why an R package is needed for analyzing political discourse: 
political discourse data comes in many types. 
While it is easier to analyze data from official speeches, where there is one speaker,
with the available R packages, this only tells a portion of the story of how and where politics gets done.
For most other settings in which political discourse appears as debates, interviews, news conferences,
or campaign rallies, where there may be multiple speakers,
the text needs to be separated or questions removed for analysis.
Dealing with these types of texts programmatically is not straightforward.
Currently it requires authors to manually code speakers, separate text by speakers,
remove specific speakers, or remove questions.
This approach becomes inviable for large amounts of political discourse data and, thus,
limits a more systematic analysis of different types of political discourse data. 

For now this is a private project, but soon it 
is set to become a source of publicly available
tools for for wrangling and 
analysing political discourses.

Keep your eyes open for it!
